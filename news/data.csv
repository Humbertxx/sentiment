"([' UPS is currently considered relatively overvalued, trading at a forward 12-month price to earnings (P/E) of 13.15X. This figure surpasses the Zacks Transportation—Air Freight and Cargo industry average of 12.72X. It is also higher than rival ', ' FDX.', '\xa0', 'The question that naturally arises is whether it is worth overpaying for the transportation heavyweight? Let us delve deeper and analyze UPS’s fundamentals and overall business environment.', 'UPS prioritizes returning capital to shareholders, as evidenced by its record of either maintaining or increasing its dividend each year since going public in 1999. Currently, UPS offers a dividend yield of 6.6%, which is higher than the 4.8% of the composite stocks in the industry. The transportation company’s above-industry dividend yield is a huge positive for income-seeking investors. This highlights the company’s confidence in its cash flow and prospects.', 'UPS has hiked its dividend five times in the past five years. This is encouraging, as stocks with a strong year-over-year dividend growth history often offer a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks. UPS’s strong dividend track implies that it is less susceptible to large swings in the market, and it acts as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty, as well as stock market volatility.', 'In addition to cheering investors with regular dividend payments, UPS is active on the buyback front. In 2023, UPS’s board approved a share repurchase authorization for $5 billion. In 2024, the company bought shares worth $500 million. In the first quarter of 2025, UPS repurchased shares worth $1 billion, completing the target for 2025.', 'Strong cash flow generation is serving UPS well, allowing the company to remain committed to returning value to shareholders. UPS demonstrates financial strength with $6.3 billion in free cash flow in 2024. Free cash flow in the first quarter of 2025 was $1.5 billion.', 'The positive developments have likely led to UPS’s premium valuations, as investors have high expectations for the company’s prospects and profitability. Consequently, they are willing to pay a premium for the stock, anticipating that it will outperform its peers and the broader market in the coming months.', 'However, there are several uncertainties regarding the stock. UPS has been suffering from revenue weakness as geopolitical uncertainty and higher inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment and growth expectations. The weak demand scenario has led to a decline in the volume of packages shipped.', 'The slowdown in online sales in the United States, apart from soft global manufacturing activity, adds to the woes. Labor expenses, courtesy of the deal with the Teamsters union, are high, limiting bottom-line growth. Amid revenue weakness, rising capital expenses as witnessed in UPS’s case are unwelcome and may dent profit margins. United Parcel Service’s high debt levels represent another concern.', 'UPS expects the second-quarter adjusted operating margin to be 9.3%. Second-quarter revenues are anticipated to be $21 billion. The effective tax rate is likely to be 23-23.5%. The average daily volume for the U.S. Domestic segment is expected to decline 9% in the June quarter. Revenues in the International Package segment are expected to decline 2% year over year in the June-end quarter. Results are scheduled to be out on July 29.', 'The uncertainties surrounding UPS are likely reflected in its price performance; UPS shares have performed disappointingly year to date, underperforming its industry and fellow industry player, ', ' GXO due to low shipment volumes.\xa0 UPS, FedEx and the industry declined 21.2%, 21.1% and 18.6%, respectively, while GXO Logistics gained 10% year to date.', '\xa0', '\xa0', 'UPS shares have plummeted 26.8% in a year, steeper than the industry’s 24% fall. FedEx and GXO Logistics have slid 24.4% and 3.9%, respectively, in a year.', 'Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for UPS’s second- and third-quarter 2025 earnings, as well as its 2025 and 2026 earnings, has moved south.', '\xa0', 'Based on the write-up, we can safely conclude that while the company’s long-term outlook is strong and some investors may be willing to accept the premium. However, caution is warranted, given the near-term concerns associated with the stock. Despite signs of easing trade tensions, we do not expect the trade-related uncertainty to dissipate until a concrete long-term trade deal is in place. As a result, due to the tariff-related uncertainty, UPS is likely to continue suffering from a demand slowdown at least in the short term.', 'Instead of rushing to invest in UPS, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it is prudent to wait for a more advantageous entry point.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system."", 'The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts.

The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Intercorp Financial Services imply an improvement in the company's underlying business.

Let us delve deeper and assess the long-term growth prospects of each bank to determine which currently presents the stronger investment opportunity.', 'Bank of America, one of the most rate-sensitive banks in the country, is prioritizing organic, domestic growth through the expansion of its physical and digital presence. This is part of a broader strategy to solidify customer relationships and tap into new markets, driving NII growth over time. By 2027, the company plans to expand its financial center network and open more than 150 centers. It sees an upside to NII in 2025, with the metric expected to rise 6-7%.', ""Coupled with the growing adoption of digital tools such as the Zelle money transfer system and the AI-powered assistant Erica, these initiatives support BAC's ability to enhance digital engagement and cross-sell a range of products, including mortgages, auto loans and credit cards."", 'Also, BAC’s IB business is poised to rebound once macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties ease. During the first quarter of 2025, the company recorded decent IB performance despite a challenging operating environment. Though its IB business performance is likely to be weak in the near term, a strong IB pipeline positions the bank to benefit from a recovery in global deal-making activity.', 'However, because of prolonged higher interest rates, BAC’s credit quality has weakened. As it remains vigilant about the effects of continuous high rates, the impact of tariffs on inflation and quantitative tightening on its loan portfolio, its asset quality is expected to remain subdued in the near term.', 'One of the biggest developments for Wells Fargo in recent days has been the lifting of the asset cap imposed in the 2018 consent order by the Federal Reserve. The removal of the growth restriction indicates the substantial progress the bank has made in addressing its deficiencies. Asset cap removal will likely result in a significant improvement in the company’s financial performance and long-term strategic positioning.', 'With this, the company can now boost deposits, grow its loan portfolio and broaden its securities holdings. This will lead to an increase in NII going forward. Moreover, WFC intends to expand fee-generating businesses like payment services, asset management and mortgage origination. These fee income-generating opportunities will bolster its top-line mix.', 'Furthermore, Wells Fargo is adopting a more balanced approach to its operations.

The company intends to become a one-stop shop for building generational wealth globally.', 'To align with its goal of becoming an international player, the company has unveiled several products and services, including expanding its advanced desktop platform, Robinhood Legend, to the U.K. following its launch in the United States in October 2024. This aims to attract more sophisticated retail investors.', 'Additionally, in May, HOOD announced an agreement to acquire Canada-based WonderFi Technologies Inc. in a C$250 million all-cash deal. Besides granting regulatory footing in Canada, the transaction strengthens the company’s position in a rapidly growing crypto market.\xa0', 'These efforts align with Robinhood’s ambition to become a global player as the company looks to expand its presence beyond the Americas and Europe into the Asia-Pacific region. During its first Investor Day conference in December 2024, CEO Vlad Tenev mentioned that the company will set up a new office in Singapore in 2025, which will serve as HOOD’s headquarters for the region.', 'The company is likely to launch digital asset trading in Singapore soon, having completed the acquisition of Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, a globally recognized cryptocurrency exchange. The deal provides Robinhood with requisite regulatory approvals, positioning the company to enter Singapore’s expanding digital assets market.', 'Robinhood has evolved from a brokerage firm primarily trading in digital assets to a more mature and diversified entity, striving to widen its market and reach. Looking at the numbers, in 2021, it mainly relied on transaction-based revenues (almost 75% of total revenues) to generate income. In 2024, this came down to nearly 56%.', 'Other initiatives by Robinhood reflect its ambition to become a comprehensive financial services provider. In March, the company launched Robinhood Strategies, Robinhood Banking and Robinhood Cortex, a suite of new features, to boost the wealth management offerings for its Robinhood Gold members. Further, it launched the prediction markets hub, allowing customers to trade on the outcomes of several major global events. Initially, the hub will be available across the United States through KalshiEX LLC, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated exchange.', 'Event contracts gained traction when Robinhood launched them in October 2024, just before the U.S. Presidential elections. Similarly, Interactive Brokers has been actively expanding its event contract offerings to capitalize on rising demand. In April, it launched prediction markets in Canada. Like HOOD, it first introduced event contracts in October 2024, starting with the U.S. election results.', 'Further, in February, Robinhood acquired Gainesville, FL-based TradePMR, a custodial (having $40 billion in assets under administration) and portfolio management platform specializing in services for Registered Investment Advisors. The company gained immediate credibility and resources to cater to wealthier investors seeking advisory solutions. By foraying into the advisory space, the company now directly competes with established players like Schwab and Fidelity Investments.', 'Moreover, in July 2024, Robinhood acquired Pluto Capital Inc. With the integration of Pluto’s advanced capabilities, the company is set to revolutionize the investment experience for its users. Also, as part of a diversification effort, HOOD launched a credit card (expanding in the consumer finance space).', 'Robinhood’s focus on the cryptocurrency space, through increased tokenization, enhanced platform capabilities and expansion into EU markets, is expected to drive greater cost efficiency and revenue growth. The company is actively pursuing Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) licenses, which would enable it to offer crypto services across the European Economic Area, expanding its reach to 27 countries.', 'The acquisition of Bitstamp and the impending WonderFi deal align with this broader strategy. Bitstamp’s core spot exchange, offering more than 85 tradable assets, will significantly strengthen Robinhood’s crypto product suite. Meanwhile, WonderFi brings two of Canada’s leading regulated crypto platforms — Bitbuy and Coinsquare — with more than C$2.1 billion in assets under custody. These will enable Robinhood to provide trading, staking and custody services.', 'As the platform diversifies and enhances its offerings, Robinhood’s cryptocurrency revenues are well-positioned for growth, supported by increasing investor interest in crypto as both a return-generating and diversification tool. Currently, Robinhood supports many major cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Solana and Toncoin.', 'In 2024, Robinhood announced a share buyback plan (for the first time) to repurchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding common stock.

The years this ETF has existed include the longest bull market in modern history, and this is a big reason it has performed so well.', "": You could set up an amplified bet on the S&P 500 on your own using things like options and futures contracts. But it can be quite complex to juggle expiration dates, leverage ratios, and options pricing.

The UltraPro S&P 500 ETF has a 0.91% expense ratio, which is significantly higher than the average index fund.', "": Perhaps most importantly, the mathematics of daily compounding can produce unexpected returns over the long run. Notice that even if you include fees, none of the long-term returns of the ETF are exactly triple the return of the index. That's because this fund isn't designed to replicate the "", ""performance of the S&P 500. It's entirely possible that the leveraged ETF could produce negative returns over a period where the S&P 500 is higher. In fact, most leveraged ETFs even have a disclaimer somewhere in their investor materials that makes it clear that they are intended for short holding periods."", ""Of course, there's no such thing as a perfect ETF for everyone – there are hundreds of ETFs in the market that could be worth a closer look for certain investors."", ""Having said that, it's tough to justify the ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF as a "", ""investment. The daily leverage dynamics give it more downside risk than upside potential, and that's especially true in times of economic and political uncertainty."", 'This ETF, and other leveraged ETFs, are best used for short-term purposes and in limited quantities. For example, if you think the S&P 500 has been the victim of a knee-jerk downward reaction, as we saw when the president announced his reciprocal tariffs in April, it could be a good way to bet on a short-term mispricing in the market.', 'However, the key word in that last sentence is ""bet,"" because that\'s exactly what you\'re doing when you invest in a triple-leveraged ETF.

An ABR of 1.32 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 81.8% and 4.6% of all recommendations.', 'Check price target & stock forecast for VICI Properties here>>>', 'The ABR suggests buying VICI Properties, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for VICI Properties, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $2.35.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for VICI Properties.

Also, its recent sourcing shift strategies to minimize tariff impacts highlight prosperous long-term visibility.', ' RH has been witnessing robust demand trends in the global market, especially in Europe. Across Europe, the market remained robust during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with demand growing 60% across RH Munich and RH Dusseldorf. Besides, the company continues to witness demand acceleration in its noncomparable galleries, RH Brussels and RH Madrid. Amid all the uncertainties, RH believes that its luxury brand positioning and unique aesthetics have emanated a strong international appeal and, in the pursuit of global expansion, will provide it with a substantial opportunity to build brand image over time.', 'Currently, RH is optimistic about its opening in Paris, with the gallery on the Champs Élysées, which is expected to open in September 2025, alongside another two openings in London and Milan in 2026. After the robust trends witnessed across its European business, RH expects to continue making meaningful investments in this market to boost further growth and profitability. In the upcoming years, RH expects to open RH Sydney, The Gallery in Double Bay, in Australia.', ' With the ongoing tariff-related risks lingering in the market, RH is positioning itself to weather the storm when it arrives. The company recently highlighted that it is currently focusing on shifting its sourcing out of China with the expectation of receipts reducing from 16% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to 2% in the fourth quarter of the same year. Besides, the company has successfully resourced a significant portion of its upholstered furniture to its North Carolina factory. By the end of 2025, it projects 52% of its upholstered furniture to be produced in the United States and 21% in Italy.', "" RH has been emphasizing several strategic initiatives to evolve from a home furnishings retailer to a luxury lifestyle brand over time. The initiatives include its focus on production elevation or transformation and retail platform expansion.

In June 2025, RH opened its freestanding RH outdoor gallery, expanding its brand presence in East Hampton. In the long term, the company’s platform expansion plans include opening seven to nine new galleries annually, with two to three Design Studios or Outdoor galleries, or new concept galleries per year.', 'RH’s earnings estimates for fiscal 2025 have trended upward in the past 30 days to $10.87 per share, which indicates robust 101.7% year-over-year growth. The analysts’ sentiments remain bullish for the year, backed by the in-house strategies RH is pulling off to counter the market risks.', 'However, even with the earnings estimates for fiscal 2026 having moved down in the past 30 days to $14.77 per share, the estimated figure indicates 35.9% year-over-year growth.', 'RH stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.04X.

The discounted valuation of the stock, compared with two of the other market players, looks promising for investors.', 'The housing market directly influences the revenue visibility and profitability of RH, as they are directly related to each other. With the current housing market softness in the United States, the benefits from the domestic market seem depressed for the company. As homebuyers are navigating through affordability concerns, new home sales remain suppressed, with renovation activities being on the dimmer side due to the inflationary pressures.', 'During the earnings call of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, RH highlighted the adverse impacts it faced due to the significant and unexpected Liberation Day tariffs announced on April 2, 2025. It believes that this sudden surge will hurt its second quarter of fiscal 2025 revenues by six percentage points, accompanied by ripple effects into order fulfillment and shipping.', 'Furthermore, even though the ongoing in-house strategies are elevating RH’s prospects, it is hitting hard on its expense structure. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the selling, general & administrative expenses (as a percentage of total net revenues) expanded 80 bps year over year to 36.8%, mainly due to elevated advertising costs related to the circulation of the Spring 2025 RH Interiors Sourcebook. Furthermore, during the quarter, the company witnessed an increase in other product costs, which partially impacted the margins. The chart below shows the SG&A expense trend in the past year.', 'As discussed above, RH is undergoing strategic efforts to weather the market uncertainties in the form of tariff-related risks, inflationary pressures and housing market softness. Given the nature of its business, RH is grappling with the current softness in the U.S. housing market.', 'However, its product elevation and platform expansion strategies, alongside robust trends across the European market, are boding well for its prospects.

The second-to-last day of the trading week saw the company's share price improve by 4% thanks in no small part to a positive analyst note. That little pop was sufficient to convincingly beat the  index's 0.8% Thursday gain.Before market open, Tobey Sommer of Truist Securities published a new research note on Parsons in which he reiterated his buy recommendation on the company's shares.According to reports, Sommer's latest Parsons take is based on the company's organic sales growth so far this year; in the analyst's opinion, this bodes well for its prospects in 2026. The pundit believes this growth will hit the mid-to-high teen percentage rates in 2025 over the previous year. 2026 should also witness improvements but at a more modest pace; Sommer believes organic growth will be only 4%.Meanwhile, according to the prognosticator, Parsons is inexpensive on its current valuations. He pointed out that it is trading 27% higher than its peer group (government services), which isn't much higher than the three-year average premium of 20%. In his view it deserves to be much higher due to the company's unique blend of federal government contracting and its work in critical infrastructure.Parsons has scored an admirable number of contract wins so far this year, so it isn't hard to be bullish on its future. As recently as this past Wednesday, it detailed plans to team up with  to build a next-generation air traffic control system for the government, and last month President Trump's administration said it scored a clutch of construction contracts abroad in .Parsons bulls should, however, heed Sommer's observation that 2026 revenue growth might not be as substantial as what he expects for this year.

"(Bloomberg) -- A flurry of Federal Reserve officials this week made clear they’ll need a few more months to gain confidence that tariff-driven price hikes won’t raise inflation in a persistent way.Most Read from BloombergFed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman captured attention in the past week when they signaled they’d be open to lowering rates as soon as the Fed’s July 29-30 meeting if inflation remains contained.Since then, however, nearly a dozen policymakers — including Chair Jerome Powell, New York Fed President John Williams and San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly — have dumped cold water on that idea.In an interview Thursday on Bloomberg Surveillance, Daly acknowledged she’s seeing increasing evidence that tariffs may not lead to a large or sustained inflation surge. But that merely made her open to a rate cut “in the fall.”“My modal outlook has been for some time that we would begin to be able to adjust the rates in the fall, and I haven’t really changed that view,” Daly said.Prices have cooled more than forecast this year, with the Fed’s preferred gauge rising 2.1% in April, just above the central bank’s 2% target.Data released earlier Thursday also showed continuing claims for unemployment benefits jumped to their highest level since November 2021, extending a sharp increase over the past six weeks and signaling more people are staying out of work for longer.

With so much remaining uncertain, he added, the central bank should wait for more clarity before adjusting rates.“There is little upside in heading too quickly in any one direction,” Barkin said. “Given the strength in today’s economy, we have time to track developments patiently and allow the visibility to improve.”Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the central bank could resume rate cuts if inflation is clearly trending toward policymakers’ 2% goal and uncertainty over the economic outlook recedes.“I’m optimistic that we’ve been getting good readings and maybe the impact of tariffs will be held just in their lane, but we want to be sure,” he said.PowellIn testimony before a congressional panel on Tuesday, Powell said the Fed would probably be cutting rates by now, based on declining inflation, if not for the uncertain outlook for future prices because of tariffs. In the meantime, there was no need to rush into any rate changes.“The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level,” Powell said. “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.”--With assistance from María Paula Mijares Torres, Amara Omeokwe, Maria Eloisa Capurro, Lisa Abramowicz and Jonathan Ferro.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","(['Bloomberg ', ' 3 hours ago'],)","(['BSFO '],)",Majority of Fed Officials Leaning Against July Interest-Rate Cut
"The UK government says it could be assessing “partial restrictions” of alcohol advertising that could be closer to regulations in place for junk food in the country.Yesterday (25 June), a report from  suggested a leaked draft of a ten-year plan for the UK's National Health Service in England included a ban on alcohol advertising.Speaking on the  podcast,  reporter Sam Coates said he had not at that point been told whether an alcohol ad ban had been removed or kept in the final plan.However a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said today: “The 10 Year Health Plan will not include a ban on alcohol advertising.”They added: “We are exploring options for partial restrictions to bring it closer in line with the advertising of unhealthy food.”Commenting on the news, The Portman Group said: “The vast majority of people drink within the Chief Medical Officer’s weekly guidelines. As such, we’re not in favour of broad, sweeping measures that impact that moderate majority whilst ignoring the needs of those who drink at the most harmful levels.“We are deeply concerned by figures that tell us that 3% of the UK population drink 30% of total alcohol consumed and so we support the use of targeted measures to manage the complex often interrelated issues resulting in harmful consumption.“The industry already takes responsible marketing very seriously and we look forward to engaging if there are future consultations around this to ensure we can continue to protect consumers.”According to the draft document, viewed by , minimum alcohol pricing, which is already in place in Scotland , was another element being assessed for England but the broadcaster was reportedly told yesterday such a move has not been included in the final plan.Restricting opening hours for shops and off-license was also reportedly considered but will also not feature.A spokesperson for the Advertising Association said: While we await to hear from the Government on the final content of its NHS 10-year strategy, it is worth noting following a recent alcohol advertising consultation in Scotland, the conclusion was that alcohol advertising should not be subject to further restrictions.“The strict regulation by the Advertising Standards Authority alongside the Portman Group’s code of practice, both of which are kept under constant review, ensures that alcohol advertising is responsible and that regulation is made on evidence. The lessons learned from the Scottish Government consultation highlight the major economic impact that restrictions would have had on Scottish tourism, sport, hospitality, culture and the funding available to businesses including the media.“The same considerations should remain true for the rest of the UK.”The Wine and Spirits Trade Association and The Scotch Whisky Association declined to comment on the news. has also contacted the British Beer and Pub Association for comment.Advertising restrictions on foods high in fat, salt, and sugar (HFSS) before the 9pm watershed are due to come into play by the start of next year, having been  from a 1 October start date. The plans also include a ban on paid-for online ads for HFSS products.The UK government said last month it had decided to go ahead with the delay due to industry feedback.It has moved the start date for the regulation to January but said it still “expects” the previous October deadline to be respected.Labour, and previous Conservative governments, have previously pledged bans on the advertising of less healthy foods, or HFSS products, in an attempt to cut obesity rates, particularly in children, and to try and lower instances of health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.The then Conservative government announced a plan in 2022 to ban the advertising of such products, initially lining up the move for April of that year. There have been a number of delays since, now including the latest push back from October to January.Ashley Dalton, the Parliamentary under-secretary has confirmed the Government planned to “make and lay” a so-called Statutory Instrument (SI) that will “explicitly exempt ‘brand advertising’ from the restrictions”.The Government, however, is still expecting the pre-9pm watershed ban on junk food advertising to be followed until the full legislation is in place from January.The latest delay was imposed to allow for a consultation period on the SI draft.""UK alcohol advertising restrictions could be “in line” with junk food"" was originally created and published by , a GlobalData owned brand. ","(['Just Drinks ', ' 3 hours ago'],)","([],)",UK alcohol advertising restrictions could be “in line” with junk food

"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are piling into speculative and volatile edges of the stock market, throwing caution to the wind as the S&P 500 Index closes in on an all-time high.Most Read from BloombergThe risks remain: President Donald Trump’s tariff pause is scheduled to end in two weeks, signs of a slowing economy and weakening consumer sentiment are mounting, and war is rumbling in the background. Wall Street strategists are encouraging everyone to buy stocks with strong balance sheets that can withstand any sudden shock. But investors appear to be ignoring all of it.The Invesco S&P 500 High Beta ETF, an exchange-traded fund that tracks highly volatile stocks, is on track for its best quarter since 2020 relative to the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF. Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs gauge of stocks with weak balance sheets is eyeing the best month relative to the S&P 500 since January.“This is the very beginning of a period of FOMO that happens in the late stages of every structural bull market — every single one,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and quantitative strategist at Evercore ISI. “What we are surprised by is the speed at which speculation has been embraced given the record bearishness just a little over two months ago and also in light of what continues to be significant economic and policy uncertainty.”The key is individual investors, who favor momentum plays like big tech stocks and speculative names. They kept buying even in early April when the S&P 500 teetered on the brink of a bear market and institutional money managers sold out during the depths of the tariff-fueled market meltdown.Buying Dips Works“Let’s go back to the various dips that we’ve seen in the market, starting with Covid,” said Paul Nolte, market strategist and senior wealth adviser at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “Every time that the market declined in a very short fashion, investors have learned: Buy the dip and buy the higher-beta type stocks.”Large-cap technology behemoths have been the main drivers of the markets in the past two years. They had a brief hiatus earlier this year when the rise of Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek raised concerns about who will dominate AI, but tech giants are back in the driver’s seat, leading the sharp recovery in the S&P 500 since the tariff selloff.“Once the tariffs kind of de-escalated, investors came back to the dominant theme, which is AI,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.This strong focus on big tech is even holding back one risky corner of the market — small-cap stocks. The small-capitalization Russell 2000 Index and the S&P 600 Index, which unlike the Russell only includes profitable smaller companies, are both lagging the S&P 500 this year and quarter.Strategists point out that technology has a relatively lighter weight in these small-cap gauges. Information technology and communication services together have a nearly 43% weight in the S&P 500, but just 13% in the Russell 2000 and and about 16% in the S&P 600.The strength of tech firms is also driving profit growth at the index level. The S&P 500’s earnings this year are estimated to grow about 8% from last year, with information technology the strongest anticipated gainer at nearly 21%.

"mericans’ wallets could be set to take a hit as the U.S. dollar has tumbled to a three-year low amid concerns about the stability and strength of the country’s economy.The dip could aid domestic businesses that export U.S. goods, but will make international travel and imports pricier for Americans. The U.S. dollar has already lost about 10% of its value this year, in contrast with the euro, which reached its highest level in nearly four years after gaining 0.4% on Tuesday.The devaluation of the dollar, the world’s dominant reserve currency, on Thursday came after news outlets reported that President Donald Trump is considering announcing a new Federal Reserve Chair this fall, ahead of the end of current Chair Jerome Powell’s term. The Wall Street the news on Wednesday. The Fed has faced pressure from Trump to lower borrowing costs, but has stopped short of doing so in order to assess the potential impact of the President’s tariffs and keep unemployment low.In addition to Trump’s tariffs, his “Big, Beautiful Bill” has contributed to uncertainty surrounding the U.S. economy. Economists have warned that the legislation  more than $2.5 trillion to the federal debt, despite claims by the Administration that it would save money.Here’s what to know about the weakening dollar.A number of factors contribute to the value of the U.S. dollar, among them how in demand it is from central banks and other financial institutions. The country’s broader fiscal situation, including inflation rates, trade relationships, debt, and trade deficits, also play a role.As economists have warned about a potential U.S. recession or economic slowdown, investors have pulled back on investing in the U.S. “The institutional quality that the U.S. had in terms of being a safe haven has been really undermined,” says Bilge Erten, a professor of economics at Northeastern University. “Why would you invest in U.S. assets when you know that the U.S. dollar is likely to continue to lose value?”Trump and his policies have contributed to many of the concerns raised about the economy in recent months. Some experts, however, say that while political factors help shape the strength of the U.S. dollar, its devaluation was projected to occur regardless of the winner of the 2024 presidential election. “No matter what happened, there was a high chance that the dollar was going to fall, and I think it's going to fall further,” says Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and author of .Rogoff, who predicted the fall of the U.S. dollar in his book, argues that its dip in value is part of  its typical fluctuation. “It had reached a high we had only seen in 2002 and 1985 and both of those times, it fell very sharply in the ensuing years,” he says. The dollar most recently saw a  around 2015, though it deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic, before rising again. Its recent high rate meant that it was projected to fall in the years to come, according to Rogoff.That’s not to dismiss the role that Trump’s policies may be playing, however.Rogoff points to the President’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs as a policy that he says “accelerated the process.”“Trump can absolutely make the dollar go down by saying, ‘I'm going to tax investors if they come into the United States,’ which is in the Senate Bill. That's obviously going to discourage money. It's going to drive down the dollar. So there are lots of ways to play with it,” Rogoff says.The dip in the U.S. dollar means that its exchange rate is less strong, making international travel more expensive for Americans. The prices of imported goods will also be higher, experts warn. “When someone from Europe is selling to the U.S., they're going to take [the dollar’s devaluation] into account, because once they convert what they get in dollars into euros, they're getting less,” says Erten. “That means they have to sell it at a higher price to get the same value.”Companies that export U.S. goods, however, may benefit from a more competitive edge. The dollar’s lowering value means that the cost of American goods and services will decrease in price when taking into account the exchange rates. “Services that U.S. workers compete for will cost less,” says Rogoff.In that respect the fall of the U.S. dollar may work to the advantage  of Trump, who has vowed to bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S. On the other hand, the labor market, which , might be impacted.

"(Bloomberg) -- US Treasuries were headed for a third week of advances, rallying on Thursday after economic data releases reinforced bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.Most Read from BloombergThe move pushed down yields across maturities, with most tenors falling to the lowest level in more than a month. A Bloomberg Treasuries index has returned about 0.6% for the week.“We’re going to continue to rock and roll for a few reasons, in terms of lower yields,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities. “There’s a real fear out there that the unemployment number a week from today is going to be a lot weaker. We’ll have month-end on Monday which could see some reallocation from equities to bonds.”Traders are turning their attention to the jobs report as it will provide a key data point ahead of the Fed’s meeting later in the month. They are already fully pricing in two cuts by year-end, starting in September, and wagers on a third quarter-point reduction could gain momentum if the number is weak.On Thursday, the growth rate for personal spending during the first quarter — part of a revision to US first-quarter gross domestic product — was unexpectedly revised to 0.5% from 1.2%. Other economic data points — including fewer-than-expected initial jobless claims — showed unexpected strength.Short-dated bonds — which are more tied to the outlook for Fed policy — gained the most following the release, with two-year yields dipping seven basis points to 3.71% by the end of the session. The widely watched spread between the five- and 30-year points increased to more than 101 basis points for the first time since 2021 and a $44 billion auction of seven-year notes was well received. A steepening yield curve is generally associated with expectations for Fed rate cuts.Some bonds were already gaining before the economic data releases following a report in the Wall Street Journal suggesting President Donald Trump is considering naming a successor to Fed chief Jerome Powell as soon as September or October.“Today’s data showed further weakness,” said Tracy Chen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. In addition, the potential early announcement of the next Fed Chair “and perceived less Fed independence will likely contribute further to the steepener move.”Investors and analysts reckon Powell’s replacement will grant the president’s demands that the Fed cut interest rates right away causing traders to price in faster and deeper cuts beginning around mid-2026, when Powell’s term ends. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in the past week have signaled they’d be open to lowering rates as soon as the next meeting.“Waller and Bowman pushing for early rate cuts has helped the front end to rally, with the curve steepening in the process,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of the BlueBay Fixed Income unit at RBC Global Asset Management. “Trump’s move to announce a Fed Chair early can increase political pressure on the Fed to cut rates and this is also a factor leading to a steeper curve.”Wagers on lower interest rates weighed on the dollar, which weakened against all of its Group-of-10 peers. The Bloomberg’s Dollar Spot Index slumped 0.5% to the lowest level in more than three years. Michael Pfister, an FX analyst at Commerzbank AG, says the euro could climb to $1.18 in the coming days if policymakers continue to price in earlier rate cuts.Potential contenders to succeed Powell include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former World Bank President David Malpass and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Bloomberg News has previously reported.Last week, US rates traders amassed a record futures bet that whomever Trump appoints will lead the central bank to cut interest rates almost immediately.In a Bloomberg Television interview, BlackRock Inc. portfolio manager Russell Brownback said the market would push back if the Fed’s independence began to come into question.“The markets would protest any kind of degradation of that independence very quickly,” he said. “I believe in the sanctity of the institution.”--With assistance from Anya Andrianova, Alice Atkins, Ruth Carson and Ye Xie.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","(['Bloomberg ', ' 1 hour ago'],)","(['BLK ', 'CRZBF '],)",US Treasuries Poised for Third Week of Gains on Rate-Cut Bets
"(Bloomberg) -- Roaring returns for US IPOs are driving fresh optimism that activity will pick up steam later this year and into 2026, even as worries over geopolitics and President Donald Trump’s tariffs hang over the market.Most Read from BloombergLed by triple-digit-percent increases for Circle Internet Group Inc. and CoreWeave Inc. — two of the year’s five largest initial public offerings on US exchanges — this year’s class of debutantes are trading up by a weighted average of about 53%, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s left investors hungry for more, particularly in a year where the S&P 500 Index has struggled to remain in the black.“We’ve been positively surprised by the way the market has handled the tariff headlines, and how investors have thought about that potential risk factor,” according to Keith Canton, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s co-head of Americas equity capital markets.That resilience could draw out some of the companies that had been planning to go before Trump’s tariffs briefly derailed activity. The US IPO calendar into summer is sparse, but the second half of 2025 has more promise.A handful of $1 billion-plus IPOs are likely before the end of the year, most of which will come after Labor Day, said Canton.Volume MirageAt nearly the half-way mark of the year, IPOs on US exchanges have raised $29.1 billion, surging 45% versus the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That’s not nearly as good as it sounds.Proceeds from IPOs are actually down from last year, when you excise the $12.1 billion of blank-check vehicle listings — an increase of more than 400% from last year. While special purpose acquisition companies have raised a lot of money in listings, some of the underwriters’ fees are deferred until the blank-check merges with a private firm and takes it public. That activity remains depressed compared to the heady levels of 2021.Excluding SPACs and tiny listings by companies raising less than $50 million, only 33 IPOs have priced this year, down from 41 in the first half of 2024.April, typically a strong month, saw only two sizable debuts, with the Trump administration’s so-called Liberation Day tariff announcement putting dozens of deals on hold.With those tensions having retreated to the background, blockbuster debuts such as stablecoin issuer Circle’s are working to restore the reputation of IPOs for fast share-price appreciation, and wealth creation.Thematically, financial technology and crypto-related companies may continue to figure heavily in the deal mix, and many investors await the return of software and biotech, sectors that historically saw plenty of activity.Private tech companies that have been on many IPO wishlists still have no shortage of alternatives to going public. ChatGPT developer OpenAI raised $40 billion from a private funding round, the latest record-setting demonstration of the depth of capital available. Still, bankers say even that has its limits.“At some point these companies want liquidity on a larger scale than private markets provide, even in an environment in which a $40 billion round is possible,” said Heath Terry, Citigroup Inc.’s global head of technology and communications research. “We will see that eventually.”Understanding Over ValuationsThe lack of near-term listings speaks to a perennial debate over whether investors and pre-IPO companies are reaching an understanding over valuations.A combination of investors’ painful memories from overpaying for IPOs in the go-go days of 2021, and asset owners’ unwillingness to go public at valuations significantly below that era’s peak, has left many companies stuck in the pipeline for the past three and a half years.The logjam may be easing. IPOs — which can include the company raising new money, backers selling existing shares, or both — have recently featured more shares offered by existing investors, known as secondary shares. These help to limit the dilution that would result from the company selling new shares at a lower valuation than the nosebleed levels achieved in previous funding rounds.“Since mid-May, we have seen greater secondary participation in IPOs, despite wider IPO discounts versus what we have seen historically,” said Jim Cooney, head of Americas ECM at Bank of America Corp.All that aside, concerns around geopolitical tensions haven’t gone away, and the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates higher than many investors — and the White House — would like. Bankers are required to balance their optimism with pragmatism, according to Clay Hale, Wells Fargo & Co.’s co-head of ECM.“The optimistic side tells you markets are trading well today, there are a lot of high-quality companies that have a desire to be in the public markets, and investors are making a decent return from IPOs,” said Hale.“The pragmatic part is that there are a lot of things going on that can grab investors’ attention, whether it be taxes, tariffs or geopolitics, which create a need to be more thoughtful.”Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","(['Bloomberg ', ' 8 hours ago'],)","(['CRCL ', 'CRWV '],)",US IPO Stocks Jump Over 50% in 2025 as Investor Appetite for Risk Grows
"BAC and  WFC are two of the U.S. Big Four banks and are designated systemically important financial institutions. Both generate substantial net interest income (NII) and have deep exposure to consumer banking, making them sensitive to interest rate trends and broader economic conditions. While they share similar macroeconomic drivers, WFC has regained strategic flexibility following the lifting of its asset cap, whereas BAC continues to leverage momentum in its investment banking (IB) operations. Let us delve deeper and assess the long-term growth prospects of each bank to determine which currently presents the stronger investment opportunity.Bank of America, one of the most rate-sensitive banks in the country, is prioritizing organic, domestic growth through the expansion of its physical and digital presence. This is part of a broader strategy to solidify customer relationships and tap into new markets, driving NII growth over time. By 2027, the company plans to expand its financial center network and open more than 150 centers. It sees an upside to NII in 2025, with the metric expected to rise 6-7%.Coupled with the growing adoption of digital tools such as the Zelle money transfer system and the AI-powered assistant Erica, these initiatives support BAC's ability to enhance digital engagement and cross-sell a range of products, including mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.Also, BAC’s IB business is poised to rebound once macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties ease. During the first quarter of 2025, the company recorded decent IB performance despite a challenging operating environment. Though its IB business performance is likely to be weak in the near term, a strong IB pipeline positions the bank to benefit from a recovery in global deal-making activity.However, because of prolonged higher interest rates, BAC’s credit quality has weakened. As it remains vigilant about the effects of continuous high rates, the impact of tariffs on inflation and quantitative tightening on its loan portfolio, its asset quality is expected to remain subdued in the near term.One of the biggest developments for Wells Fargo in recent days has been the lifting of the asset cap imposed in the 2018 consent order by the Federal Reserve. The removal of the growth restriction indicates the substantial progress the bank has made in addressing its deficiencies. Asset cap removal will likely result in a significant improvement in the company’s financial performance and long-term strategic positioning.With this, the company can now boost deposits, grow its loan portfolio and broaden its securities holdings. This will lead to an increase in NII going forward. Moreover, WFC intends to expand fee-generating businesses like payment services, asset management and mortgage origination. These fee income-generating opportunities will bolster its top-line mix.Furthermore, Wells Fargo is adopting a more balanced approach to its operations. While the bank is reducing headcount and streamlining processes, it is investing in its branch network and digital upgrades. This allows the bank to maintain a focus on cost management.Wells Fargo is taking a strategic approach to its branch network, reducing its total branches by 3% year over year to 4,177 in 2024. At the same time, it is focused on modernization, having upgraded 730 branches last year, with plans to revamp the entire network over the next five years. These efficiency efforts are expected to drive $2.4 billion in gross expense reductions in 2025.While 2025 started on a positive note, Trump’s tariff plans and geopolitical tension resulted in massive volatility, upending bullish investor sentiments. This year, shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo gained 6.6% and 12.5%, respectively. Further, both have outpaced the S&P 500 Index. In terms of investor sentiments, Wells Fargo clearly has the edge.In terms of valuation, BAC is currently trading at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 11.83X, while the WFC stock is currently trading at a 12-month forward P/E of 12.79X. Further, both are trading at a discount compared with the industry average of 14.21X. So, Bank of America is inexpensive compared to WFC.BAC’s dividend yield of 2.22% is more than Wells Fargo’s 2.02%. Nonetheless, both are higher than the S&P 500 average dividend yield of 1.22%. Bank of America’s return on equity (ROE) of 10.25% is below WFC’s 12.15%. Further, the industry’s ROE is 11.93%. This reflects that WFC is more efficiently using shareholder funds to generate profits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAC’s 2025 and 2026 revenue implies year-over-year growth of 6.1% and 5.8%, respectively. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates a 12.5% and 16.3% rise for 2025 and 2026, respectively. On the contrary, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC’s 2025 and 2026 revenue implies year-over-year growth of just 1.7% and 5.4%, respectively. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates a 9.1% and 14.4% rise for 2025 and 2026, respectively. While both banks present compelling cases, Wells Fargo appears better positioned for near-term upside, thanks to its regained growth flexibility post asset-cap lift, operational streamlining and stronger ROE. Improving investor sentiment and WFC’s solid price performance further strengthen the case. However, for long-term-focused investors, Bank of America’s robust digital strategy, expanding physical footprint and rebound potential in IB may offer superior growth. Nonetheless, its near-term prospects are clouded by asset quality deterioration.Hence, Wells Fargo offers a stronger blend of stability and near-term growth.Currently, BAC and WFC carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.And older Americans have legitimate reasons for this worry, even if they have dutifully saved for their golden years. That's because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses - and with people generally living longer, the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren't producing income? You can only cut your expenses so far, and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income.We feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.6 per share, with a dividend yield of 8.95%. This compares to the Transportation - Shipping industry's yield of 1.64% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.6%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 200%.

Check Urban Edge Properties dividend history here>>>The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.You may be thinking, ""I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF."" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

" HOOD shares hit an all-time high of $85.55 during Wednesday’s trading session, fueled by investor confidence in the company’s strategic growth initiatives. Strong momentum and increased buying activity helped propel the stock to new heights.This year, HOOD stock has soared 122.1%, massively outperforming the industry’s rally of 14.9%. In contrast, shares of  SCHW gained 21.4%, while  IBKR rose 18.4%.Let’s take a closer look at Robinhood’s fundamentals to assess whether the stock still offers upside or if the rally has already run its course.Robinhood has evolved significantly since the meme stock frenzy of early 2021, emerging as a serious competitor to established online brokerage players like Interactive Brokers and Schwab. The company intends to become a one-stop shop for building generational wealth globally.To align with its goal of becoming an international player, the company has unveiled several products and services, including expanding its advanced desktop platform, Robinhood Legend, to the U.K. following its launch in the United States in October 2024. This aims to attract more sophisticated retail investors.Additionally, in May, HOOD announced an agreement to acquire Canada-based WonderFi Technologies Inc. in a C$250 million all-cash deal. Besides granting regulatory footing in Canada, the transaction strengthens the company’s position in a rapidly growing crypto market. These efforts align with Robinhood’s ambition to become a global player as the company looks to expand its presence beyond the Americas and Europe into the Asia-Pacific region. During its first Investor Day conference in December 2024, CEO Vlad Tenev mentioned that the company will set up a new office in Singapore in 2025, which will serve as HOOD’s headquarters for the region.The company is likely to launch digital asset trading in Singapore soon, having completed the acquisition of Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, a globally recognized cryptocurrency exchange. The deal provides Robinhood with requisite regulatory approvals, positioning the company to enter Singapore’s expanding digital assets market.Robinhood has evolved from a brokerage firm primarily trading in digital assets to a more mature and diversified entity, striving to widen its market and reach. Looking at the numbers, in 2021, it mainly relied on transaction-based revenues (almost 75% of total revenues) to generate income. In 2024, this came down to nearly 56%.Other initiatives by Robinhood reflect its ambition to become a comprehensive financial services provider. In March, the company launched Robinhood Strategies, Robinhood Banking and Robinhood Cortex, a suite of new features, to boost the wealth management offerings for its Robinhood Gold members. Further, it launched the prediction markets hub, allowing customers to trade on the outcomes of several major global events. Initially, the hub will be available across the United States through KalshiEX LLC, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated exchange.Event contracts gained traction when Robinhood launched them in October 2024, just before the U.S. Presidential elections. Similarly, Interactive Brokers has been actively expanding its event contract offerings to capitalize on rising demand. In April, it launched prediction markets in Canada. Like HOOD, it first introduced event contracts in October 2024, starting with the U.S. election results.Further, in February, Robinhood acquired Gainesville, FL-based TradePMR, a custodial (having $40 billion in assets under administration) and portfolio management platform specializing in services for Registered Investment Advisors. The company gained immediate credibility and resources to cater to wealthier investors seeking advisory solutions. By foraying into the advisory space, the company now directly competes with established players like Schwab and Fidelity Investments.Moreover, in July 2024, Robinhood acquired Pluto Capital Inc. With the integration of Pluto’s advanced capabilities, the company is set to revolutionize the investment experience for its users. Also, as part of a diversification effort, HOOD launched a credit card (expanding in the consumer finance space).Robinhood’s focus on the cryptocurrency space, through increased tokenization, enhanced platform capabilities and expansion into EU markets, is expected to drive greater cost efficiency and revenue growth. The company is actively pursuing Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) licenses, which would enable it to offer crypto services across the European Economic Area, expanding its reach to 27 countries.The acquisition of Bitstamp and the impending WonderFi deal align with this broader strategy. Bitstamp’s core spot exchange, offering more than 85 tradable assets, will significantly strengthen Robinhood’s crypto product suite. Meanwhile, WonderFi brings two of Canada’s leading regulated crypto platforms — Bitbuy and Coinsquare — with more than C$2.1 billion in assets under custody. These will enable Robinhood to provide trading, staking and custody services.As the platform diversifies and enhances its offerings, Robinhood’s cryptocurrency revenues are well-positioned for growth, supported by increasing investor interest in crypto as both a return-generating and diversification tool. Currently, Robinhood supports many major cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Solana and Toncoin.In 2024, Robinhood announced a share buyback plan (for the first time) to repurchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding common stock. In April, the company increased its existing authorization by $500 million to $1.5 billion. As of April 30, 2025, approximately $833 million worth of shares remained available for repurchase. HOOD plans to complete the remainder of its total authorization over the next roughly two years.Robinhood is on solid ground, with significant cash reserves. As of March 31, 2025, it reported cash and cash equivalents of $4.42 billion.Robinhood operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to the scrutiny of numerous authorities. This, thus, exposes the company to regulatory risks, resulting in hefty fines and restrictions that may affect its profitability. In March 2025, Robinhood’s units agreed to pay $26 million to settle allegations by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for failing to respond to red flags about potential misconduct and not verifying the identities of thousands of customers.In January 2025, the company agreed to pay a $45 million fine for violating more than 10 securities law provisions. In September 2024, the company faced a $3.9 million penalty to settle failures related to crypto withdrawals. In 2023, the company faced defeat in proceedings at the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court regarding the supervision of product features and marketing strategies and paid a fine of $7.5 million.These fines have made investors cautious about the company’s operations and internal control procedures.Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 and 2026 has been revised upward to $1.23 and $1.47, respectively. This reflects a bullish sentiment among analysts.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOOD’s earnings implies 12.8% and 21.3% year-over-year growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively.Given the impressive price performance, HOOD shares are currently trading at a massive premium to the industry. The company has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 60.98X compared with the industry average of 14.21X.Meanwhile, Schwab and Interactive Brokers have forward P/E ratios of 19.26 and 28.65, respectively. Thus, HOOD is expensive compared with its peers, too.Yet, Robinhood’s global expansion, strategic acquisitions, new product launches and diversification efforts will likely help it grow its market share and presence. Rising investor demand for cryptocurrency and solid liquidity are other positives.Nonetheless, concerns have been raised regarding increased regulatory oversight due to the blurred distinction between gambling and trading in the prediction markets hub. Also, foraying into the banking business amid intense competition keeps investors cautious about its success. Uncertainties related to tariffs pose a near-term risk. Hence, investors must keep an eye on macro developments and other headwinds and see how Robinhood is navigating the challenging times. Thus, the stock is a cautious bet for long-term investors, but they should be prepared for short-term volatility.At present, Robinhood carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF aims to generate three times the daily return of the S&P 500.Since its inception in 2009, the ETF has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.There are several pros and cons to consider before investing.If the S&P 500 historically generates total returns of about 10% annually, wouldn't some investment vehicle that amplifies its returns be even better? That's exactly what the   does.This ETF aims to triple the daily returns of the , so if the benchmark index goes up 1% tomorrow, you can expect the ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF to rise by about 3%. It achieves this by using financial derivative instruments such as futures contracts and stock options.However, it's important to mention that while this ETF is certainly capable of producing amplified returns in good times, it isn't even close to being a surefire way to get market-beating performance in your portfolio over the long run. In other words, if the S&P 500 goes up by 20% over the next two years, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll get a 60% return from this ETF.Let's take a closer look at how this leveraged ETF works, the pros and cons, its long-term performance history so far, and whether it could be a good fit for you.Of course, no analysis of an ETF would be complete without taking a look at its performance, so let's start there, as it sheds light on many of the ETFs pros and cons. The UltraPro S&P 500 ETF has been trading for a little over 15 years, so here's how it's done versus the S&P 500 over various time periods, compared with the non-leveraged  :1 year7.1%10.6%3 years143%66%5 years277%108%10 years622%237%Since inception (6/23/09)4,520%611%Data source: yCharts.There are a few key things to keep in mind while analyzing the performance. First, this ETF has mostly existed in , which has certainly helped its long-term performance. The numbers would tell a  different story if it had started trading in, say, 2007, before the financial crisis hit.Second, notice that so far in 2025, the UltraPro S&P 500 ETF has underperformed the S&P 500 even though the benchmark index is higher for the year. That's the mathematics of  leveraged returns, which I'll discuss more later.Third, and this isn't on the chart, is that in bad times the leverage can  work against you. For example, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the S&P 500 fell by about 30% from its prior highs. The UltraPro ETF fell by nearly 80%. Be prepared for things like this if you invest.Like any ETF, there are pros and cons to consider, so let's look at them, starting with the positives:: Most obviously, a triple-leveraged ETF could deliver stronger returns than a standard ETF if the underlying index performs well. The years this ETF has existed include the longest bull market in modern history, and this is a big reason it has performed so well.: You could set up an amplified bet on the S&P 500 on your own using things like options and futures contracts. But it can be quite complex to juggle expiration dates, leverage ratios, and options pricing. By purchasing shares of a leveraged ETF, the fund's managers do it for you, and you can invest just as easily as buying any stock.Before investing there are a few potentially negative things to keep in mind:: , by definition, are more volatile than their unlevered counterparts. Even in good market environments, it's important to be prepared for significant price swings.: The more specialized an ETF is, the higher the investment fees typically are. The UltraPro S&P 500 ETF has a 0.91% expense ratio, which is significantly higher than the average index fund.: Perhaps most importantly, the mathematics of daily compounding can produce unexpected returns over the long run. Notice that even if you include fees, none of the long-term returns of the ETF are exactly triple the return of the index. That's because this fund isn't designed to replicate the performance of the S&P 500. It's entirely possible that the leveraged ETF could produce negative returns over a period where the S&P 500 is higher. In fact, most leveraged ETFs even have a disclaimer somewhere in their investor materials that makes it clear that they are intended for short holding periods.Of course, there's no such thing as a perfect ETF for everyone – there are hundreds of ETFs in the market that could be worth a closer look for certain investors.Having said that, it's tough to justify the ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF as a investment. The daily leverage dynamics give it more downside risk than upside potential, and that's especially true in times of economic and political uncertainty.This ETF, and other leveraged ETFs, are best used for short-term purposes and in limited quantities. For example, if you think the S&P 500 has been the victim of a knee-jerk downward reaction, as we saw when the president announced his reciprocal tariffs in April, it could be a good way to bet on a short-term mispricing in the market.However, the key word in that last sentence is ""bet,"" because that's exactly what you're doing when you invest in a triple-leveraged ETF. Things can go wrong quickly, so it's important to have a clear plan going in, and to limit your position size to money you could comfortably afford to lose.Before you buy stock in ProShares Trust - ProShares UltraPro S&p500, consider this:The  analyst team just identified what they believe are the  for investors to buy now… and ProShares Trust - ProShares UltraPro S&p500 wasn’t one of them.

"Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin stated Thursday that tariffs are likely to increase inflation in the coming months, while indicating that current monetary policy is appropriately positioned.""I do believe we will see pressure on prices,"" Barkin said in prepared remarks for the New York Association for Business Economics.Barkin noted that while tariff increases have had minimal effects on inflation so far, more pressure is expected as businesses plan to pass on at least some of the higher import taxes imposed by President Donald Trump to consumers.Despite these concerns, Barkin does not anticipate the inflationary impact to reach the levels experienced during the pandemic. He suggested consumers might shift away from tariffed goods, potentially limiting some price increases.The Federal Open Market Committee kept its overnight target rate unchanged at between 4.25% and 4.5% at its meeting last week. The central bank remains cautious as tariffs are expected to increase inflation while potentially slowing economic growth and hiring.Barkin acknowledged risks to both the Fed’s employment and inflation mandates but did not specify future policy direction. He emphasized that the current economic strength allows for patient monitoring of developments.""When it does [improve visibility], we are well positioned to address whatever the economy will require,"" Barkin stated.The Richmond Fed president described the current economic situation as positive, with ""encouraging"" recent inflation data and ""healthy"" job growth.Related articles","(['Investing.com ', ' 8 hours ago'],)","(['SPY '],)",Fed’s Barkin says tariffs will push inflation higher
"NVDL is an ETF that aims to double Nvidia’s daily gains.But it resets itself on a daily basis, doubles its losses, and charges high fees.It would be smarter to invest in Nvidia instead. , one of the market's hottest growth stocks, has surged 27,590% over the past decade as its sales of discrete GPUs soared. That boom was largely fueled by the expansion of the AI market, which drove many companies to upgrade their data centers with its top-tier GPUs to process complex machine learning and AI tasks.Nvidia's stock rose about 16% over the past 12 months, even as the company grappled with tighter export curbs, tariffs, and other macroeconomic headwinds. However, investors who wanted even bigger gains were likely drawn toward the  , which aims to double Nvidia's gains on a daily basis.That sounds like an incredible way to profit from the , but is it really a good investment? Let's review the two reasons to buy the Granite Shares ETF -- and three reasons to avoid it.The Granite Shares ETF might be an appealing investment for two reasons. First, it can help short-term traders generate big gains from any news or earnings-driven rallies for Nvidia.Second, it aims to double the chipmaker's daily returns with total-return swaps and other derivatives. These derivatives can be difficult for mainstream investors to understand, so the ETF simplifies the process in a package and eliminates the need for a margin account or options trading. Therefore, investors won't ever lose more than their initial investment or be hit by margin calls during a downturn.The NVDA Daily ETF might sound like a good way to profit from Nvidia's gains, but it has three glaring weaknesses. First, its gains aren't cumulative because it resets its 2x objective on a daily basis. Second, it also doubles Nvidia's losses if it declines.So while the ETF might be a good short-term play if Nvidia's stock rallies for several consecutive days, a single red day can wipe out a lot of those gains. That's why the NVDA Daily ETF has been a terrible investment for the long term. Over the past 12 months, its shares actually declined 17% even as Nvidia's stock rose.Even if Nvidia rallies over a long period, the ETF can suffer a volatility drag behind its underlying stock because it makes adjustments every day to meet its investment objective. That constant rebalancing, along with its leverage, makes it tougher for the fund to stay ahead of Nvidia and meet its goal of doubling the chipmaker's daily returns.Lastly, the NVDA Daily ETF charges a high net annual operating expense ratio of 1.15%, and it only aims to double Nvidia's daily returns ""before fees and expenses."" For long-term investors, it would be cheaper to simply buy Nvidia stock directly or invest in a low-cost ETF like the  -- which tracks the Nasdaq-100 for a low expense ratio of 0.20% and includes exposure to Nvidia along with dozens of other Nasdaq-listed stocks.Warren Buffett famously told investors to be fearful when others are greedy. And the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF clearly targets greedy investors and doesn't seem like a better buy than Nvidia. It's designed for day traders, it charges high fees, and it will likely underperform Nvidia over the long term.If you're bullish on Nvidia, you should simply . From fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028 (which ends in January 2028), analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share to have compound annual growth rates of 30% and 28%, respectively, as it keeps selling the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush -- and it still looks reasonably valued at 35 times this year's earnings.Buying this ETF might help you outperform Nvidia over a few days, but it will sorely disappoint investors who expect it to magically double the chipmaker's returns over the next few years.Before you buy stock in GraniteShares ETF Trust - GraniteShares 2x LongDA Daily ETF, consider this:The  analyst team just identified what they believe are the  for investors to buy now… and GraniteShares ETF Trust - GraniteShares 2x LongDA Daily ETF wasn’t one of them.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rebounded sharply in May, boosted by a surge in commercial aircraft bookings, though economic uncertainty stemming from import tariffs remains a constraint for business spending on capital.Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, jumped 16.4% last month after a revised 6.6% decline in April, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Thursday.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast orders increasing 8.5% after a previously reported 6.3% decrease in April.Transportation equipment orders soared 48.3%, driven by a 230.8% surge in commercial aircraft orders, which are extremely volatile. Boeing reported on its website that it had received 303 aircraft orders, including 150 from Qatar Airways placed during President Donald Trump's visit to the Gulf Arab country in May.That compared to only eight orders in April.Outside the transportation industry, orders were muted. Economists say Trump's often shifting trade policy has left businesses in limbo while the duties already imposed have increased costs for companies.The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode as policymakers monitor the economic fallout from the sweeping tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week the U.S. central bank needed more time to gauge if tariffs pushed up inflation before considering lowering rates.The Fed last week left its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range where it has been since December.Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rebounded 1.7% in May after an upwardly revised 1.4% decline in April.Economists had forecast these so-called core capital goods orders edging up 0.1% after a previously reported 1.5% drop in April.Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.5% after being unchanged in the prior month. Non-defense capital goods orders accelerated 49.4% after plunging 19.1% in April. Shipments of these goods were unchanged after advancing 3.6% in April.Business spending on equipment accelerated sharply in the first quarter, helping to blunt some of the drag on gross domestic product from a flood of imports as businesses rushed to bring in merchandise before the tariffs came into effect.The Atlanta Fed is forecasting economic growth rebounding at a 3.4% annualized rate in the second quarter, largely reflecting a reversal in the import flows.Data on retail sales, the housing and labor markets have suggested economic activity is softening.

Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68% and 4% of all recommendations.Check price target & stock forecast for Affirm Holdings here>>>The ABR suggests buying Affirm Holdings, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Affirm Holdings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $0.03.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Affirm Holdings.

"Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Affiliated Managers Group (AMG). AMG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 7.65, while its industry has an average P/E of 17.02. AMG's Forward P/E has been as high as 8.93 and as low as 6.14, with a median of 7.39, all within the past year.Investors should also note that AMG holds a PEG ratio of 0.59. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AMG's industry has an average PEG of 1.20 right now. Over the past 52 weeks, AMG's PEG has been as high as 0.71 and as low as 0.47, with a median of 0.57.We should also highlight that AMG has a P/B ratio of 1.31. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.63. Over the past 12 months, AMG's P/B has been as high as 1.39 and as low as 1.01, with a median of 1.27.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. AMG has a P/S ratio of 2.65. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 3.03.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Affiliated Managers Group's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

" (PSO) has been beaten down lately with too much selling pressure. While the stock has lost 11.1% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefiting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.The heavy selling of PSO shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 28.88. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering PSO in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 1.2% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, PSO currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

"Buffett has built a fortune by sticking to the basics, such as companies with strong brands and consistent, growing profits -- and holding for the long run.Many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks trade at lofty valuations and have unpredictable growth prospects, making them speculative opportunities.One semiconductor stock sticks out to me given its discounted valuation relative to peers, robust long-run prospects, and leading market position.Warren Buffett is one of the most prolific investors in modern history. For six decades, he helped build  into an investment powerhouse --  over this period. For reference, these returns are nearly double the total return of the .One aspect of  that is rather unique, however, is that he did not pack Berkshire's portfolio with growth stocks or seek opportunities in emerging technologies. For these reasons, you won't find much in the way of software, artificial intelligence (AI), or semiconductors among Buffett's top stocks.Let's explore some of the pillars supporting Buffett's investment criteria. From there, I'll make the case for which AI chip stock I think fits many of Buffett's requirements -- making it a unique value opportunity in an otherwise high-growth industry at the moment.Some of the largest positions in Berkshire's portfolio include , , , , , and .There are a number of threads that stitch these companies together. First, each has achieved a high level of brand equity. This keeps consumers loyal over time, thereby insulating the overall business from competitive forces.In addition, each of these companies generates heaps of cash. Cash flow is important, as it provides the business with the financial flexibility to reinvest into new products or reward investors in the form of share buybacks or dividends.Finally, Buffett is a contrarian. While some of the companies above may face cyclical risks, Buffett has remained steadfast in his ability to look past short-term headwinds and keep the long-term growth narrative in focus. As a value investor, he often pounces on opportunities that others have discounted.One AI stock that I think checks off many of Buffett's boxes is  . But don't take my word for it, Berkshire did briefly own Taiwan Semi stock a couple of years ago.On the surface, this pick may come across as unusual. After all, Taiwan Semi faces some geopolitical risk given uncertainties surrounding its relationship with China. In fact, these risk factors played a role in Berkshire eventually exiting its TSMC position back in 2023. Moreover, the chip industry is highly cyclical, adding yet another layer of uncertainty surrounding the company's growth.Like Buffett, however, I'm going to act as a contrarian to support my personal long-term bull thesis surrounding TSMC.Similar to many stocks in Berkshire's portfolio, Taiwan Semi has built a robust brand moat. While the company faces some competition from  and , industry research suggests that Taiwan Semi owns more than 60% of the foundry market. Not only does this provide TSMC with a healthy lead over the competition, but secular tailwinds could actually help the company separate from the pack even more.Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure spend to reach nearly $7 trillion by next decade. Furthermore, McKinsey is forecasting that almost half of this spending will be allocated toward hardware for data centers.With new chipsets expected to be released by  and , in combination with custom silicon solutions from cloud hyperscalers , , and , I am optimistic that Taiwan Semi's fabrication services will continue to see robust demand over the coming years.The chart below illustrates the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple trend for TSMC and other leading chip stocks over the past year.The obvious takeaway from the chart is that Taiwan Semi trades for a steep discount relative to Nvidia and , based on forward earnings ratios. This could suggest that Taiwan Semi is an undervalued opportunity within the chip space right now. With that said, a forward P/E of 22.2 is above the historical average for the S&P 500 -- which is around 17.While Buffett likely wouldn't see Taiwan Semi as a value stock, I would counter this due to the fact that the broader market is trading at lofty valuations in general, and TSMC is still much more reasonably priced compared to its chip peers.In addition, Wall Street's consensus forecasts suggest Taiwan Semi has significant growth in store over the next few years. Thanks to ongoing infrastructure spending and robust demand for chips, TSMC could nearly double its profitability over just the next two years.Given the company's long-run growth prospects and rising profitability profile, I think Taiwan Semi is a bargain and investors should consider this monster opportunity for the long haul.Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The  analyst team just identified what they believe are the  for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

"Shares of  (ASC) have gained 6.4% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $10.08, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $13.17 indicates a potential upside of 30.7%.The average comprises three short-term price targets ranging from a low of $12.50 to a high of $14.00, with a standard deviation of $0.76. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 24% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 38.9% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for ASC, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.There has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 16.2%.Moreover, ASC currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term.

" ICE hit a 52-week high of $181.65 on June 25. Shares closed at $180.53 after gaining 21.2% year to date, outperforming the industry, the sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite in the same time frame.Intercontinental has outperformed its peers, including CBOE, CME and NDAQ. Shares of CBOE, CME and NDAQ have gained 17.9%, 17.6% and 13.9%, respectively, year to date.With a market capitalization of $103.55 billion, the average number of shares traded in the last three months was 3.2 million.Shares of Intercontinental are trading above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) of $173.34 and $164.01, respectively, indicating solid upward momentum. SMA is a widely used technical analysis tool to predict future price trends by analyzing historical price data.Intercontinental shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings of 24.72X, lower than the industry average of 26.25X. Its pricing, at a discount to the industry average, gives a better entry point to investors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Intercontinental Exchange’s 2025 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 14.5%. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.96 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 7.3%. The consensus estimate for 2026 earnings per share and revenues indicates an increase of 10.4% and 5.7%, respectively, from the corresponding 2025 estimates. The expected long-term earnings growth rate is 13.3%, outperforming the industry average of 10.1%.Seven of the nine analysts covering the stock have raised estimates for 2025, while seven of the 10 analysts have raised the same for 2026 over the past 60 days. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 and 2026 moved 1.3% and 1.2% north, respectively, in the last 60 days.Based on short-term price targets offered by 17 analysts, the Zacks average price target is $194.18 per share. The average suggests a potential 7.3% upside from the last closing price.Intercontinental surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters and matched in one, the average being 1.30%.ICE’s top line is poised to improve on strength in global data services and index business, growth in pricing and reference data business, and strength in ICE Global Network offering, solid desktop, feeds and derivatives analytics. The company has been achieving expense synergies from strategic acquisitions, which have also strengthened its portfolio and expanded its presence.ICE boasts the largest mortgage network across the United States and thus remains well-positioned to benefit from accelerated digitization in the residential mortgage industry.ICE continuously engages in strategic investments supported by a healthy and minimal risk-based balance sheet, which also offers stability and buoyancy over the medium to long term.However, operating expenses have been increasing over the last several years, weighing on margin expansion. With continuous growth initiatives like product launches and technology upgrades, we believe that expenses are likely to remain elevated in the near term.Though the debt balance declined, its leverage as well as times interest earned compares unfavorably with the industry average.ICE is poised for growth, banking on the strength of its compelling portfolio and expansive risk-management services, which also ensure revenue flow, as well as strategic buyouts, a solid balance sheet and effective capital deployment. Its dividend history is impressive. It has more than doubled its dividends in the last six years.Optimistic analyst sentiment, favorable growth estimates, as well as attractive valuations, should continue to benefit ICE over the long term.It is, therefore, wise to hold on to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock at present.

"(Bloomberg) -- Investors betting against Palantir Technologies Inc. are throwing in the towel as the software maker’s shares keep pushing higher, aided by fervent retail traders and heightened geopolitical tensions.Most Read from BloombergShort interest in Palantir as a percentage of shares available to trade is about 2%, down from a high of 5% in October, according to data from S3 Partners. The stock has rallied nearly 300% over that span, handing short sellers paper losses of roughly $7 billion. Shares extended that gain in early trading Thursday, rising as much as 3.7%, on track for a record close.Palantir, which makes software used by governments and corporations to analyze large volumes of data, is the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year amid excitement about its artificial intelligence products and signs that it’s winning more business from the Trump administration. Palantir is also the most expensive stock in the benchmark, however, with a price to estimated sales ratio of 76 times. Nvidia Corp., by contrast, is priced at 17 times.The momentum behind Palantir, which helped send shares to a fresh intraday record on Wednesday, has made it dangerous to bet against, even though the valuation is difficult to justify, said Thomas George, president at Grizzle Investment Management.“The frenzy can go on for longer than the bears or shorts would like, and we’ve seen too many people get their fingers chopped off trying to short something,” George said. “It really feels like the stock is trading on vibes.”While Palantir stands out on Wall Street for both its lofty multiple and the size of its rally, the stock has proven remarkably resilient, frustrating those betting on a reversal. Some have even likened it to a meme stock, given the heavy interest from retail investors who think demand for AI software will keep Palantir’s revenue expanding at a rapid clip.Palantir’s work with government and military customers has been in particular focus in recent sessions as US strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran over the weekend raised the specter of a broader conflict in the Middle East. President Donald Trump announced a surprise ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran following more than a week of drone and missile attacks between the countries.“Palantir is in the right area code for the future of defense tech, so the market could view a fair tailwind from the events over the weekend,” George said. It “is clearly a beneficiary of heightened geopolitical tensions, but even heightened geopolitical tensions don’t justify Palantir’s valuation.”The Denver-based company is expected to see sales jump 36% this year, followed by an expansion of 29% in 2026, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That places Palantir among the fastest growing companies in the Nasdaq 100.Valuation is the key sticking point on Wall Street. Fewer than a third of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, an unusually low rate among companies with market capitalizations in excess of $300 billion. Based on the average price target, analysts see downside of 25% over the coming year, the weakest implied return in the Nasdaq 100 Index.The institutional hesitancy has been overshadowed by heavy interest from individual investors. In terms of client orders, Palantir is consistently one of the most active securities on Interactive Brokers’ platform, according to the firm’s data. Vanda Research, which analyzes retail trading, ranks Palantir as the third-highest stock by net retail purchases, behind Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp., which are both substantially larger.“Palantir trades at a ridiculous multiple, but welcome to the world of AI stocks,” said Louis Navellier, chief executive officer of Navellier & Associates, who owns the stock.“The stock should be safe in the near term, since there’s certainly a need for cost-efficient intel and I don’t think the AI party will end soon,” he said. “Still, while the short sellers have gotten pretty quiet, the multiple means they’ll come back. They always do.”Tech Chart of the DayNvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world.Top Tech NewsMicron Technology Inc., Wall Street’s favorite chipmaker this year, delivered an outlook that wasn’t quite rosy enough to keep its 2025 rally going.After a chastening crackdown that wiped billions off their value and forced top executives out of the public eye, China’s technology giants are back in favor and on the front foot, making deals and snapping up assets.The unveiling of Xiaomi Corp.’s first electric SUV on Thursday will showcase how the Chinese tech company has become an investor darling with its high-stakes bet on the auto market.Reconova Technologies Co., a Chinese artificial intelligence company specializing in visual perception, is planning a Hong Kong initial public offering as soon as this year, according to people familiar with the matter.Earnings Due ThursdayNo major earnings expected--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.(Adds stock move after market open in second paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","(['Bloomberg ', ' 8 hours ago'],)","(['NVDA ', 'TSLA '],)",Palantir Short Sellers Bail as Top S&P 500 Stock Keeps Climbing
"Marvell Technology nosedived earlier this year after providing disappointing guidance.Tariffs and economic uncertainty continue to weigh on the California-based chipmaker.Its valuation has come way down, which could make it more appealing now to investors.Shares of Marvell were already beginning to decline before its guidance miss earlier in the year, likely due to its inflated valuation. The stock had been an expensive buy, trading at a  of more than 40 (based on analyst expectations). At such a high premium, analysts are expecting the company to not only post strong numbers, but also to provide a strong guidance.Currently, however, Marvell stock trades at a forward P/E of 26, which is only slightly higher than the 23 times forward P/E of the average stock on the S&P 500. With Marvell generating revenue growth in excess of 60% in its most recent quarter, the higher premium may very well be justifiable if it can maintain a high level of growth.But the risk is that tariffs and potentially slowing economic conditions could affect its top and bottom lines in the near future. Should that happen, this stock could once again start to look very expensive.Before you buy stock in Marvell Technology, consider this:The  analyst team just identified what they believe are the  for investors to buy now… and Marvell Technology wasn’t one of them.

"The second quarter of 2025 saw sharp volatility in the U.S. stock market, driven by Trump’s aggressive tariff policies and escalating geopolitical tensions. The S&P 500 is now less than 1% away from an all-time high, a stunning turnaround considering the index was teetering on the edge of a bear market just two months ago.With just a few days left to end the second quarter, the Nasdaq Composite Index outperformed, jumping 15.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Index gained 8.5% and 2.3%, respectively. We have highlighted five top-performing ETFs from different industries that were the leaders in the second quarter. These are  URA,  CRPT, ARKW, HERO and  GOEX.After nearly entering a bear market in April and erasing $9.8 trillion in market value, the S&P 500 rebounded sharply in May and June, fueled by a strong comeback in tech stocks and trade negotiation optimism. The S&P 500 jumped 6.15% in May, its best monthly gain since November 2023 and its strongest May since 1990. It has added another 3% so far in June, regaining trillions in market value.Renewed enthusiasm for U.S. tech and AI stocks, especially NVIDIA NVDA and Microsoft MSFT, bolstered investors’ sentiment during the quarter. The Nasdaq 100 hit a fresh record high on Tuesday, its first since February. With rates still high and volatility lingering, the mega-cap tech names are proving to be the market’s new safe haven (read: 5 Stocks Driving Nasdaq 100 ETF Higher in 2025).Trump has softened his stance on tariffs and taken a measured approach to trade negotiations. While only a trade deal with the UK and a tentative truce with China have been announced, many investors believe the worst of the tariff fallout may be behind them.The average tariff rates are now at their highest in 90 years. Such elevated levels could suppress growth, reignite inflation, and keep interest rates elevated, thereby creating headwinds for stocks in the short term.Hopes of de-escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict boosted market sentiment this week, easing risk-off pressures. Let’s dig into the details of the abovementioned ETFs:Global X Uranium ETF provides investors access to a broad range of companies involved in uranium mining and the production of nuclear components, including those in extraction, refining, exploration, or manufacturing of equipment for the uranium and nuclear industries.

"Investors in AMTM need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the July 18, 2025 $30.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Amentum Holdings shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Amentum Holdings is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Engineering - R and D Services industry that ranks in the Top 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 52 cents per share to 54 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Amentum Holdings right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

"The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is a convenient way to invest in prominent, dividend-paying stocks.The ETF has delivered a mix of growth and passive income throughout its history.A high starting yield and attractive valuation make it great to buy and hold for the long term.Investors should always diversify their portfolios, but it's absolutely crucial when it comes to dividend stocks. It would be a nightmare scenario if something happened to a stock that you depended on for a significant chunk of your investment income.Fortunately,  make diversification quick and straightforward. One fund could represent hundreds, even thousands, of individual companies. The  is one of the best dividend ETFs to buy for anyone looking for decades of passive income.Here are five reasons why any long-term dividend investor should consider buying and holding it forever.The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the , a bucket of approximately 100 large-cap U.S. dividend stocks across various market sectors, including energy, consumer staples, healthcare, industrials, financials, technology, consumer discretionary, and communications services.The ETF features mature companies with track records of paying and raising dividends.

Table by author.The remainder is spread across abiut 90 dividend stocks, offering investors a healthy dose of portfolio diversification through a single ticker symbol.An investment's initial dividend yield isn't everything; a lot of the magic happens over time as the dividend grows. Still, unless you're very young, it's nice to start with meaningful dividend income.The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF delivers an impressive 30-day  of almost 3.9% at its current price. For comparison, the  yields approximately 1.3%, so investors are getting roughly three times as much passive income for their buck as they would from the broader U.S. stock market.Ideally, your investment income will grow over time -- at least fast enough to keep up with inflation. Fortunately, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has done well here, too. As shown, the fund's dividend has trended in the right direction over time, growing by more than 500% cumulatively since its inception in late 2011.The ETF rebalances quarterly and reconstitutes annually, so its makeup could change over time, and the dividend may not always increase at this rate. Still, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has demonstrated over the past 14 years that it's reasonable to anticipate those dividends growing larger over the decades to come.There is sometimes a misperception that investing for passive income must come at the expense of total investment returns. While it's true that stocks of mature companies often come with higher dividend yields and lower price appreciation, investors can still achieve a mix of both income and growth, and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has delivered just that outcome.The ETF doesn't attempt to track the S&P 500 index, but it has produced competitive total investment returns for most of its existence, up until the past few years. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF only has about 8% exposure to the technology sector, which has caused the ETF to lag the ""Magnificent Seven""-heavy S&P 500 since the artificial intelligence (AI) boom began in 2023.The AI boom has lifted the broader market to a lofty valuation. The S&P 500's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (28) is notably above its average over the past decade. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF's blended P/E ratio is currently 16. Many of the ETF's top holdings aren't exactly high-growth names, but it's clear that the ETF trades at a steep discount to the broader market, and at a time when the latter is trading well above its norms.This doesn't matter as much if you're buying the ETF to hold for decades of passive income, but it's always good to buy up a deal, and the ETF's current valuation means it could perform better relative to the broader market if the AI craze cools off some.Before you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:The  analyst team just identified what they believe are the  for investors to buy now… and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn’t one of them.

"Big banks like JPM,  GS and  BAC are expected to easily clear the 2025 stress test, the results of which will be released tomorrow, given that this year’s test will be less stressful than last year.A less severe scenario this year implies that banks will perform better and be in a position to return more money to investors via share repurchases and dividends.Each year, the Federal Reserve’s stress test assesses the capacity of the biggest U.S. banks to withstand a significant economic downturn. The “annual health checkup” is used to determine the most recent minimum capital requirements, which are intended to cushion potential losses. It further dictates the size of share repurchases and dividends.Notably, the 2008 financial crisis gave rise to this annual assessment, which covered institutions with at least $100 billion in assets.The Fed evaluates the financial resilience of banks by estimating losses, revenues, expenses and resulting capital levels under hypothetical economic conditions. A baseline scenario and a severely adverse scenario are used for assessment.The severely adverse scenario is characterized by a hypothetical severe global recession accompanied by a period of heightened stress in commercial and residential real estate markets, and corporate debt markets.This year, the severely adverse scenario features a slightly smaller increase in the unemployment rate from the 2024 severely adverse scenario. The current scenario also features slightly smaller declines in house prices and a fall in commercial real estate prices that is 10% less than that in 2024.Thus, a favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration is expected to make the 22 banks that are tested more flexible as they manage capital and increase dividends.Vivek Juneja, an analyst at JPMorgan, said, “With the improved regulatory tone, hopes are high for some reduction in capital requirements... driven by less harsh stress tests.”Despite the more stressful scenarios last year, big banks took turns returning excess capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases after clearing the test.JPMorgan raised its quarterly dividend 8.7% to $1.25 per share. It was the second time that the company raised its quarterly dividend in 2024. JPM also authorized a $30-billion share repurchase program, which became effective on July 1, 2024.Likewise, Goldman Sachs’ capital plan included an increase in the common stock dividend from $2.75 to $3.00 per share. Bank of America also increased its dividend in third-quarter 2024.While this year’s situation is expected to be better than last year, with big banks anticipated to announce higher dividend increases, banks will likely remain somewhat conservative in the near term, given the ongoing tariff-related uncertainty, along with other geopolitical concerns.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"Both  NLY and  STWD are mortgage real estate investment trusts (mREITs) that invest in mortgage-backed and other real estate-related securities. Both REITs are exposed to the same macroeconomic risks but differ in their portfolio strategies and risk profiles.But which one offers the better opportunity for investors right now? Let us break down the strengths, risks and growth potential of NLY and STWD.NLY's investment strategy is driven by the prudent selection of assets and effective capital allocation to achieve stable returns. The strategy includes traditional Agency MBSs, which provide downside protection, and investments in more non-agency and credit-focused asset classes that enhance returns.A scaled mortgage servicing rights (MSR) platform will continue to benefit from a low prepayment environment. The company is focusing on improving its capabilities by acquiring newly originated MSRs from its partner network, which will continue to provide a strong advantage in expanding its MSR business. As of March 31, 2025, its investment portfolio aggregated $84.9 billion.As mortgage rates are witnessing a declining trend lately, purchase originations and refinancing activities are improving. Hence, NLY will likely witness book value improvement in the coming period as spreads in the Agency market tighten, driving asset prices. This should boost net interest spread, improving the portfolio's overall yield. This is expected to support the company’s financials in the upcoming period.Annaly is focused on improving its liquidity and reducing leverage to support capital distribution activities. By the end of the first quarter of 2025, the company had $7.5 billion in total assets available for financing, including cash and unencumbered Agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of $4.7 billion, which can readily provide liquidity in times of adverse market conditions.NLY has a record of paying out monthly dividends, currently yielding a staggering 14.6%. It presently sits at a payout ratio of 101%. In March, the company announced a cash dividend of 70 cents per share, marking a 7.7% hike from the prior payout. This move reflects confidence in its cash flow and growth prospects.STWD’s investment strategy includes investment in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and related commercial real estate assets, with a diversified portfolio of $1.02 billion as of March 31, 2025. This allows it to generate stable income streams while capitalizing on market opportunities. The company’s asset management expertise and ability to navigate the complexities of the CMBS market contribute to its strong market position and growth potential.Starwood has been engaged in acquisitions and divestitures to optimize its portfolio. In February 2024, the company sold 16 retail properties in its Master Lease Portfolio for $387.1 million, recognizing a gain of $92 million. Additionally, it sold an operating property within its Real Estate Investment and Services Equity Portfolio for $18.2 million, with a gain of $8.3 million, reflecting continued portfolio optimization.The company also sold residential units in a New York conversion project, totaling $12.1 million in proceeds, though with no gain or loss recognized. Meanwhile, there were no significant acquisitions recently, aside from properties acquired through loan foreclosure. This strategy of selective sales and reinvestments supports the company's ongoing focus on enhancing its portfolio.However, Starwood Property’s weak liquidity position is concerning. As of March 31, 2025, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $692 million. Its long-term debt was $18.4 billion. This can be concerning if the macroeconomic situation worsens.The company pays out a quarterly dividend of 48 cents currently. It has a dividend yield of 9.5% with a payout ratio of 108%. Over the last five years, STWD did not increase its dividend.Over the past year, shares of Starwood and Annaly have risen 13.7% and 11.8%, respectively, compared with the industry’s growth of 5.2%. In terms of valuation, STWD is currently trading at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 10.87X, higher than its five-year median of 10.58X. Alternatively, the NLY stock is currently trading at a 12-month forward P/E of 6.65X, which is lower than its five-year median of 7.27X.  NLY is trading at a discount compared with the industry average of 7.96X, while STWD is trading at a premium. Hence, Annaly is a better choice for value investors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NLY’s 2025 and 2026 earnings reflects a year-over-year rise of 6.3% and 1.4%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Annaly’s 2025 and 2026 earnings has been revised upward over the past 60 days, suggesting a bullish outlook from analysts.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for STWD’s 2025 earnings suggests a year-over-year decline of 10.9%, while that for 2026 indicates a rise of 7.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for STWD’s 2025 and 2026 earnings has been revised downward over the past 60 days, suggesting a more cautious outlook from analysts.  While both Annaly and Starwood offer attractive dividend yields and operate in the same broader mREIT sector, NLY stands out as the more resilient and better-valued option for now. Its focus on lower-risk Agency MBS, a growing mortgage servicing rights platform, improved liquidity and positive earnings momentum provide a stronger foundation for long-term growth.In contrast, STWD’s heavier exposure to commercial real estate, higher debt levels and downward earnings revisions make it a riskier choice for now.For investors looking for stable income with lower risk, Annaly offers the more compelling opportunity right now.At present, Annaly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Starwood carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).You can seeWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"(Reuters) -BlackRock is set to include private assets in its retirement plans as it expands into alternative investments, the world's largest asset manager said on Monday.The move marks a significant shift in how retirement products are structured, bringing traditionally illiquid and high-fee private market investments into mainstream retirement portfolios.The New York-based firm plans to offer a target-date fund - an age-based retirement investment that combines stocks, bonds and other assets - with allocations to private equity and private credit in the first half of 2026.Retirement money is a core business for BlackRock and accounts for more than half of the money the company manages.As a push towards that move, BlackRock is providing some public and private market offerings for a new target-date retirement fund offered by Great Gray Trust.Great Gray, which offers retirement investment options and manages over $210 billion in assets, will use BlackRock's equity and fixed income index offerings as well as private equity investments for its fund.The Wall Street Journal first reported the move earlier in the day.BlackRock's approach would include a 5% to 20% allocation to private assets in the retirement plans, depending on the investor's age, according to a research paper released on Thursday.While the demand for exposure to private assets has grown, some sponsors have concerns around adding them to retirement plans for reasons such as liquidity, transparency and litigation risk.BlackRock CFO Martin Small said earlier this month there was a real pathway for private markets making their way into target-date funds, adding that it will take some regulatory support.The firm estimates that adding private markets exposure to target-dated funds could increase returns by an additional 50 basis points each year.BlackRock anticipates portfolios in the future will comprise 50% public equities, 30% public fixed income and 20% private markets.(Reporting by Arasu Kannagi Basil in Bengaluru; Editing by Shreya Biswas)","(['Reuters ', ' 7 hours ago'],)","(['BLK '],)",BlackRock looks to expand private markets to retirement plans

The Nasdaq, nearing all-time highs as of Wednesday’s close (and getting there on the Nasdaq 100) is down 40 points to 74 at this hour.

"Stocks hitting their 52-week high and delivering consistent performance offer attractive opportunities to investors while building a portfolio. This is because stocks near that level are perceived to be winners. However, stocks touching a new 52-week high are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals. Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices. Stocks such as DB,  JNPR,  ATRO and  FHI are expected to maintain their momentum and keep scaling new highs. Extensive information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here, we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The strategy borrows from the basics of momentum investing. This technique bets on “buy high, sell higher.”Many times, stocks that hit a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encourage investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.: This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.: It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.: This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.: The lower, the better.: This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.: This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $8 or higher. The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are four stocks, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1, out of the 14 that made it through the screen:continues to benefit from a well-diversified and steadily expanding deposit base.

Its cash, central bank, and interbank balances totaled €159 billion, compared with only €15.1 billion in short-term borrowings. DB has embarked on a digital transformation drive, focusing on cloud migration, AI, and automation to enhance operational efficiency and client services. In May 2025, Deutsche Bank reinforced its strategic partnership with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) through a new license agreement, gaining greater access to IBM’s advanced software solutions, including the watsonx AI portfolio, to streamline workflows, reduce costs, and enhance client services.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DB’s 2025 earnings has moved north by 5.9% to $3.39 per share in the past 30 days.

Higher commercial transport sales, primarily related to increased demand from airlines for cabin power and in-flight entertainment as well as connectivity products, backed by growing global commercial air traffic, are expected to bolster ATRO’s Aerospace business segment’s sales. Higher sales from military aircraft markets, backed by enhanced geopolitical tensions worldwide, are likely to aid this unit’s sales growth in the near term. Expanding commercial air traffic worldwide remains a major growth catalyst for ATRO. ATRO also enjoys a solid presence in the defense industry, which provides its portfolio with a diversified cushion against any crisis.

" RH, previously known as Restoration Hardware, is a luxury retailer in the home furnishing space, whose share price performance has dropped 23.2% in the past three months compared with the Hoya Capital Housing ETF (HOMZ) index’s 4.9% decline. HOMZ is an exchange-traded fund that offers a diversified glimpse of the U.S. residential housing industry through 100 companies across homebuilding, rental operators, home improvement, furnishings, mortgage services and real estate tech, to name a few.This California-based company’s prospects are currently ailing from the ongoing softness in the country’s housing market. RH’s business is directly related to housing demand patterns, as softness in housing demand weakens renovation and home furnishing demand, especially in luxury. Moreover, the ambiguity surrounding the implementation of tariffs is adding to its concerns, alongside the increasing expense structure due to its ongoing brand expansion and elevation strategies.RH has been trailing behind the other renowned market players, including  WSM,  ETD and  ARHS, during the past three months when considering the share price performance. Even though Williams-Sonoma, Ethan Allen and Arhaus are standing above RH, their share price performance has also tumbled 3.4%, 1.7% and 9.2%, respectively, during the said time frame.However, on the brighter side, the long-term prospects of RH seem appealing thanks to the strategic investments it is undergoing across its brand portfolio. The company is realizing incremental benefits from its global expansion efforts, apart from its product transformation and platform enhancement activities. Also, its recent sourcing shift strategies to minimize tariff impacts highlight prosperous long-term visibility. RH has been witnessing robust demand trends in the global market, especially in Europe. Across Europe, the market remained robust during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with demand growing 60% across RH Munich and RH Dusseldorf. Besides, the company continues to witness demand acceleration in its noncomparable galleries, RH Brussels and RH Madrid. Amid all the uncertainties, RH believes that its luxury brand positioning and unique aesthetics have emanated a strong international appeal and, in the pursuit of global expansion, will provide it with a substantial opportunity to build brand image over time.Currently, RH is optimistic about its opening in Paris, with the gallery on the Champs Élysées, which is expected to open in September 2025, alongside another two openings in London and Milan in 2026. After the robust trends witnessed across its European business, RH expects to continue making meaningful investments in this market to boost further growth and profitability. In the upcoming years, RH expects to open RH Sydney, The Gallery in Double Bay, in Australia. With the ongoing tariff-related risks lingering in the market, RH is positioning itself to weather the storm when it arrives. The company recently highlighted that it is currently focusing on shifting its sourcing out of China with the expectation of receipts reducing from 16% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to 2% in the fourth quarter of the same year. Besides, the company has successfully resourced a significant portion of its upholstered furniture to its North Carolina factory. By the end of 2025, it projects 52% of its upholstered furniture to be produced in the United States and 21% in Italy. RH has been emphasizing several strategic initiatives to evolve from a home furnishings retailer to a luxury lifestyle brand over time. The initiatives include its focus on production elevation or transformation and retail platform expansion. It aims to continue elevating its products' design and quality while opening large, immersive Design Galleries, which blur the line between retail and hospitality.Recently, RH highlighted the launch of its 2025 RH Outdoor Sourcebook, the new RH Interior Sourcebook and the RH Modern Sourcebook, which offer collections including furniture, textiles, lighting, rugs and much more. The company remains optimistic about the introduction of its new design aesthetic, Japandi, that amalgamates the essence of Japanese serenity and Scandinavian simplicity.Already into 2025, for the remainder of the year, RH expects to open seven Design galleries at locations including RH Montreal, RH Paris, RH Detroit, RH Manhasset, RH San Diego and RH Palm Desert. In June 2025, RH opened its freestanding RH outdoor gallery, expanding its brand presence in East Hampton. In the long term, the company’s platform expansion plans include opening seven to nine new galleries annually, with two to three Design Studios or Outdoor galleries, or new concept galleries per year.RH’s earnings estimates for fiscal 2025 have trended upward in the past 30 days to $10.87 per share, which indicates robust 101.7% year-over-year growth. The analysts’ sentiments remain bullish for the year, backed by the in-house strategies RH is pulling off to counter the market risks.However, even with the earnings estimates for fiscal 2026 having moved down in the past 30 days to $14.77 per share, the estimated figure indicates 35.9% year-over-year growth.RH stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.04X. This is compared with the forward 12-month P/E ratios of 18.23X, 10.64X, and 19.22X at which Williams-Sonoma, Ethan Allen and Arhaus are currently trading. The discounted valuation of the stock, compared with two of the other market players, looks promising for investors.The housing market directly influences the revenue visibility and profitability of RH, as they are directly related to each other. With the current housing market softness in the United States, the benefits from the domestic market seem depressed for the company. As homebuyers are navigating through affordability concerns, new home sales remain suppressed, with renovation activities being on the dimmer side due to the inflationary pressures.During the earnings call of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, RH highlighted the adverse impacts it faced due to the significant and unexpected Liberation Day tariffs announced on April 2, 2025. It believes that this sudden surge will hurt its second quarter of fiscal 2025 revenues by six percentage points, accompanied by ripple effects into order fulfillment and shipping.Furthermore, even though the ongoing in-house strategies are elevating RH’s prospects, it is hitting hard on its expense structure. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the selling, general & administrative expenses (as a percentage of total net revenues) expanded 80 bps year over year to 36.8%, mainly due to elevated advertising costs related to the circulation of the Spring 2025 RH Interiors Sourcebook. Furthermore, during the quarter, the company witnessed an increase in other product costs, which partially impacted the margins. The chart below shows the SG&A expense trend in the past year.As discussed above, RH is undergoing strategic efforts to weather the market uncertainties in the form of tariff-related risks, inflationary pressures and housing market softness. Given the nature of its business, RH is grappling with the current softness in the U.S. housing market.However, its product elevation and platform expansion strategies, alongside robust trends across the European market, are boding well for its prospects. Although in the short term, RH is expected to witness a slight setback, in the long term, the growth trends remain bright, as witnessed from the earnings expectation trend.Before taking any decisions regarding RH stock, investors must weigh both sides of the market currently. Thus, based on the discussion, it is prudent for existing investors to retain this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares for now, whereas new investors might want to wait for a more favorable entry point.You can see .Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"Pre-market futures are up this morning, though by slimmer margins upon a bevy of economic data hitting the tape. The Nasdaq, nearing all-time highs as of Wednesday’s close (and getting there on the Nasdaq 100) is down 40 points to 74 at this hour. The Dow went from 105 to 90 points and the S&P 500 has remained constant at 15 points.While Initial  have come down -9K to 236K from a slightly upwardly revised 245K the prior week — which is good: the lowest print since mid-May, in fact — it’s that carries the bigger story this morning. Longer-term jobless claims reached 1.974 million two weeks ago (Continuing Claims are reported a week in arrears from new claims), above 1.9 million for the fifth-straight week and the highest level we’ve seen since mid-November of 2021.For the first part of 2025, we were ping-ponging around that 1.9 million level, but now jobless claims on the longer-term side are clearly trying to break out. And, while 1.9 million is merely a psychological touch-point, once Continuing Claims reaches 2 million per week, expect a change in the narrative — including from the Fed — on our steady and secure labor market.The usually doesn’t waver too much from estimates, but in this case, -0.5% is more than twice as low as the first revision to -0.2% (-0.3% was the original Q1 GDP print). This is the weakest quarter since Q1 2022. We see Consumption cut by more than half from the previous read: from +1.2% last time to +0.5% this morning. The  and core both tick up 10 basis points (bps) to +3.8% and +3.5%, respectively.

Stripping out airlines, airplanes and transportation, we see a still-strong +0.5% — the highest print since September of last year. Officially, non-defense, ex-aircraft came in at +1.7%, and that’s the largest tally we’ve seen since January.The  for May reached -$96.6 billion, sinking deeper from the upwardly revised -$87.0 billion. We’re thankfully off the early 2025 levels that hit record lows in March of -$162 billion, but still pretty deep in the hole. Imports remained fairly steady but Exports fell -5.2% for the month. in May jumped to +0.3% month over month and +3.2% year over year. , on the other hand, sank -0.3% for the month and +1.4% from the year-ago number. All of this data can be seen through the prism of tariff realities — both those already levied and those anticipated, which led to much higher trading volume ahead of reciprocal tariffs, which remain murky looking ahead.Once the regular trading day gets going,  for May will come out.

" UPS is currently considered relatively overvalued, trading at a forward 12-month price to earnings (P/E) of 13.15X. This figure surpasses the Zacks Transportation—Air Freight and Cargo industry average of 12.72X. It is also higher than rival  FDX. The question that naturally arises is whether it is worth overpaying for the transportation heavyweight? Let us delve deeper and analyze UPS’s fundamentals and overall business environment.UPS prioritizes returning capital to shareholders, as evidenced by its record of either maintaining or increasing its dividend each year since going public in 1999. Currently, UPS offers a dividend yield of 6.6%, which is higher than the 4.8% of the composite stocks in the industry. The transportation company’s above-industry dividend yield is a huge positive for income-seeking investors. This highlights the company’s confidence in its cash flow and prospects.UPS has hiked its dividend five times in the past five years. This is encouraging, as stocks with a strong year-over-year dividend growth history often offer a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks. UPS’s strong dividend track implies that it is less susceptible to large swings in the market, and it acts as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty, as well as stock market volatility.In addition to cheering investors with regular dividend payments, UPS is active on the buyback front. In 2023, UPS’s board approved a share repurchase authorization for $5 billion. In 2024, the company bought shares worth $500 million. In the first quarter of 2025, UPS repurchased shares worth $1 billion, completing the target for 2025.Strong cash flow generation is serving UPS well, allowing the company to remain committed to returning value to shareholders. UPS demonstrates financial strength with $6.3 billion in free cash flow in 2024. Free cash flow in the first quarter of 2025 was $1.5 billion.The positive developments have likely led to UPS’s premium valuations, as investors have high expectations for the company’s prospects and profitability. Consequently, they are willing to pay a premium for the stock, anticipating that it will outperform its peers and the broader market in the coming months.However, there are several uncertainties regarding the stock. UPS has been suffering from revenue weakness as geopolitical uncertainty and higher inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment and growth expectations. The weak demand scenario has led to a decline in the volume of packages shipped.The slowdown in online sales in the United States, apart from soft global manufacturing activity, adds to the woes. Labor expenses, courtesy of the deal with the Teamsters union, are high, limiting bottom-line growth. Amid revenue weakness, rising capital expenses as witnessed in UPS’s case are unwelcome and may dent profit margins. United Parcel Service’s high debt levels represent another concern.UPS expects the second-quarter adjusted operating margin to be 9.3%. Second-quarter revenues are anticipated to be $21 billion. The effective tax rate is likely to be 23-23.5%. The average daily volume for the U.S. Domestic segment is expected to decline 9% in the June quarter. Revenues in the International Package segment are expected to decline 2% year over year in the June-end quarter. Results are scheduled to be out on July 29.The uncertainties surrounding UPS are likely reflected in its price performance; UPS shares have performed disappointingly year to date, underperforming its industry and fellow industry player,  GXO due to low shipment volumes.  UPS, FedEx and the industry declined 21.2%, 21.1% and 18.6%, respectively, while GXO Logistics gained 10% year to date.  UPS shares have plummeted 26.8% in a year, steeper than the industry’s 24% fall. FedEx and GXO Logistics have slid 24.4% and 3.9%, respectively, in a year.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for UPS’s second- and third-quarter 2025 earnings, as well as its 2025 and 2026 earnings, has moved south. Based on the write-up, we can safely conclude that while the company’s long-term outlook is strong and some investors may be willing to accept the premium. However, caution is warranted, given the near-term concerns associated with the stock. Despite signs of easing trade tensions, we do not expect the trade-related uncertainty to dissipate until a concrete long-term trade deal is in place. As a result, due to the tariff-related uncertainty, UPS is likely to continue suffering from a demand slowdown at least in the short term.Instead of rushing to invest in UPS, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it is prudent to wait for a more advantageous entry point.

" ARKK, which provides thematic multi-cap exposure to “disruptive innovation”, has been on a hot streak in June. It has gained about 23%, becoming the best-performing ETF of the month.Most of the rally came from the explosive moves in a few stock holdings of ARKK. CRCL soared nearly 750% from its June 5 IPO, powered by U.S. Senate passage of the GENIUS Act, which formalizes stablecoin regulation. The stock accounts for a 5.2% share in the ARKK portfolio. COIN jumped nearly 30% mid-June after announcing plans to launch its own stablecoin, boosting crypto optimism. The stock occupies the second position in the ETF portfolio, accounting for 9.6% of the assets. Meanwhile, RBLX, which makes up for 7% share in the ARKK basket, rallied 8.8% on strong first-quarter results.  TSLA, ARKK's largest holding with a 9.9% share, has been riding high in June, fueled by excitement around autonomous driving and robotaxi development. The electric carmaker launched its long-anticipated driverless robotaxi service in Austin on June 22, sending its shares up as much as 10% on June 23. Despite some recent profit-taking, ARK maintained conviction in Tesla's position (read: Capitalize on Tesla's Robotaxi Momentum With These ETFs).Enthusiasm for generative artificial intelligence also pushed PLTR shares to new records last week. The stock has risen 8.4% so far this month. PLTR has a 4.4% share in the ARKK basket.Cathie Wood, the high-profile CEO of Ark Investment Management, remains especially bullish on the transformative power of emerging technologies. ""During the current turbulent transition in the United States, she believes consumers and businesses will accelerate the shift toward innovation platforms, including artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and multiomics sequencing.”ARKK added shares in NVIDIA NVDA and BWX Technologies BWXT to ride AI and nuclear tailwinds. The purchase of more than 128,000 shares of NVDA, worth roughly $18.5 million, came on the heels of bullish guidance from its CEO, Jensen Huang, particularly around quantum computing and a pivot away from China in response to escalating export restrictions. The move reflects ARKK’s commitment to next-generation computing, even amid rising geopolitical uncertainty.ARKK purchased more than $30 million worth of BWXT, reflecting Wood’s deepening bet on nuclear energy. The timing coincides with favorable legislative tailwinds in the United States, as nuclear energy emerges as one of the few politically viable clean energy options (read: ARK ETFs Surged Last Week: Here's Why). Known for backing high-growth tech stocks even in volatile times, Wood expanded its stake in Advanced Micro Devices AMD last week, acquiring 247,753 shares valued at approximately $31.4 million across three ETFs. The purchase was distributed among ARKK, ARK Next Generation Internet ARKW and ARK Fintech Innovation ARKF ETFs, underscoring ARK’s ongoing conviction in AI and semiconductor stocks. AMD is ARKK’s 12th biggest holding, accounting for 2.6% of the portfolio.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of ARKK.ARK Innovation ETF is an actively managed fund investing in companies that benefit from the development of new products or services, technological improvements and advancements in scientific research related to the areas of DNA technologies and genomic revolution, automation, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, next generation Internet and Fintech innovation.

"When Warren Buffett makes an  move, people notice.

Buffett’s company had owned these low-cost ETFs for years, so this move raised eyebrows.Buffett didn’t publicly comment on his decision to offload these funds. However, if you happen to own a stake in either — or both — of these funds, you might be wondering if you should also sell.GOBankingRates spoke with two financial experts to speculate on . Keep reading to find out what they had to say, so you can decide if you should hold your positions or follow suit.Investors often try to mimic Buffett’s moves, but fail to achieve the same effect for two reasons, said Shawn Perkins, certified financial planner (CFP), accredited wealth management advisor (AWMA) and founder of .First, Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway have an infinite time horizon, which means that they care very little about the short-term — and sometimes violent — swings in the markets,” he said. “Most individual investors do not have this luxury.”Additionally, he said Berkshire Hathway’s investment moves aren’t revealed until after they’ve been made — sometimes months later.“By then, the value captured or strategic position by Berkshire may have already passed, leaving  in position to buy or sell at an inopportune time,” he said. “As for the March sale of the S&P, perhaps Buffet saw a turbulent market ahead, which indeed happened and decided to trim [and/or] reinvest his capital elsewhere.”Alternately, he said Buffett may have just been doing some housekeeping on his portfolio.“Either way,  should listen to Buffet’s wisdom regarding long-term optimism for investing, but should think carefully before mimicking his actions,” he said.Worth noting, John Boyd, CFP and founder and lead wealth advisor at , said the two stocks in question — VOO and SPY — only made up about 1% of Buffett’s portfolio.Personally, he wasn’t that surprised about the sale.“Warren Buffett is an ultra-high  individual,” he said. “It’s common for individuals at that level to own the underlying stocks of the S&P 500 directly through a direct indexing strategy.”This approach can offer greater cost efficiency and possibly even more favorable tax treatment, he said.This article originally appeared on : ","(['GOBankingRates ', ' 6 hours ago'],)","(['VOO ', 'SPY '],)",Warren Buffett Just Dumped These 2 Investments — Should You Do the Same?
"Intercorp Financial Services Inc. (IFS) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Intercorp Financial Services basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Intercorp Financial Services imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .This company is expected to earn $4.34 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2025, which represents no year-over-year change.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Intercorp Financial Services. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.6%.Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of ""buy"" and ""sell"" ratings for its entire universe of more than 4,000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a ""Strong Buy"" rating and the next 15% get a ""Buy"" rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>The upgrade of Intercorp Financial Services to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at , a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Crown Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CCK that show why this packaging company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For CCK, shares are up 3.78% over the past week while the Zacks Containers - Metal and Glass industry is up 3.42% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.15% compares favorably with the industry's 6.15% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market.

"The companies operating in the Zacks Utility -Electric Power industry offer a compelling opportunity due to their stable cash flows and regulated business models. Domestic-focused utilities typically operate under long-term power purchase agreements, which safeguard against economic cycles. The rising demand for electricity and systematic capital investment is increasing the efficiency of operations, which enables utilities to maintain stable earnings and are well-positioned to distribute regular dividends to shareholders. Utility power companies are currently going through an energy transition. Many are actively investing in clean energy infrastructure, including solar, wind, battery storage and grid modernization. As the world moves toward decarbonization, utilities that are early adopters of renewables and low-carbon technologies stand to benefit from an expanded market and reduced fuel cost volatility, enhancing their appeal to institutional and retail investors alike. Amid such a backdrop, let’s compare  VST and T SO. These prominent U.S. electric utilities are actively investing in renewable energy, making them pivotal players in the shift toward cleaner power generation.The Southern Company offers stable, long-term value through its regulated utility operations and strategic investments in clean energy. With a diversified generation mix, strong customer base, and constructive regulatory environment, it delivers reliable earnings and dividend growth. Its commitment to decarbonization, including nuclear expansion and renewable integration, positions it well for the evolving energy transition.Vistra Energy is emerging as a major player in the nuclear energy sector. Its 2023 acquisition of Energy Harbor significantly bolstered its nuclear asset base and led to the creation of Vistra Vision, a dedicated subsidiary focused on zero-carbon power generation. Additionally, the company is advancing clean hydrogen projects linked to its nuclear fleet, leveraging federal tax incentives provided under the Inflation Reduction Act.Given that both companies are prominent players in the utility industry, it’s worthwhile to take a closer look at their fundamentals. A detailed comparison will help determine which stock offers a more attractive investment opportunity for investors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vistra’s earnings per share in 2025 and 2026 has increased by 3.7% and 2.84%, respectively, in the past 60 days. Long-term (three to five years) earnings growth per share is pegged at 13.18%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for The Southern Company’s earnings per share in 2025 has gone down by 0.23% in the past 60 days, and 2026 earnings per share has moved up by 0.22% in the same time period. Long-term (three to five years) earnings growth per share is pegged at 6.55%.ROE is an essential financial indicator that evaluates a company’s efficiency in generating profits from the equity invested by its shareholders. It demonstrates how well management is utilizing the capital provided to increase earnings and deliver value. VST’s current ROE is 87.03% compared with SO’s ROE of 12.7%. NEE outperforms the industry’s ROE of 10.09%.Dividends are regular payments made by a company to its shareholders and represent a direct way for investors to earn a return on their investment. They are an important indicator of a company’s financial health and stability, often signaling strong cash flow and consistent earnings. Utilities are known for regular dividend payments to their shareholders.Currently, the dividend yield for Vistra is 0.48%, while the same for The Southern Company is 3.26%. The dividend yields of both companies are lower than their industry’s yield of 3.27%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vistra’s sales estimates in 2025 and 2026 reflects year-over-year growth of 28.91% and 4.53%, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Southern Company’s sales estimates in 2025 and 2026 reflects year-over-year growth of 5.84% and 3.7%, respectively.The Zacks Utilities sector is a capital-intensive one, and huge investments are required at regular intervals to upgrade, maintain and expand operations. The usage of new evolving technology also requires investments. Therefore, utilities borrow from the market and add it to their internal cash generation to fund their long-term investments.Vistra’s debt-to-capital currently stands at 77.12% compared with Duke Southern Company’s debt-to-capital of 64.83%. Both companies are using higher debt to fund their business, as the industry’s debt-to-capital stands at 60.81%.Vistra currently appears to be trading at a premium compared with The Southern Company on a Price/Earnings Forward 12-month basis. (P/E- F12M).VST is currently trading at 26.29X, while SO is trading at 20.44X compared with the industry’s 15.29X.Vistra and The Southern Company are strategically investing in their infrastructure to serve customers more efficiently and reliably.Based on the above discussion, The Southern Company currently has a marginal edge over Vistra, despite the stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. SO’s relatively lower debt usage to run operations, cheaper valuation, and higher dividend yield make it a better choice in the utility space.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"Despite all the drama and all the dips, surprise, surprise, here comes another S&P 500 all-time high.The first half of 2025 was a wild ride, to say the least.However, with all the chaos, comebacks, and curveballs, the S&P 500 might pull off a surprise that rewrites the first-half script.The S&P 500 ended at 6,092 on Wednesday, shy of its February closing peak of 6,144. On Thursday, it's trading just shy of a new record near 6,130 at 11am EST.Oil bounced 2% as Middle East tensions eased, and big-picture worries like tariffs and the spending bill paused.However, let’s just say the next move might be heating up before the NYSE closing bell rings again.The S&P 500’s ride through 2025 so far has been a total financial soap opera.We’re talking highs, steep drops, and nonstop global turmoil that’s kept investors strapped in tight.The S&P 500 wrapped 2024 around 5,815, before ripping past the 6,000 mark by January 23, closing at 6,118.71.By February 19, it hit a fresh all-time high of 6,144.15, and profit-taking hit the brakes.Two key drivers drove those gains, including blowout earnings and cooling inflation. Mega-cap tech continued to storm ahead, smashing expectations across the board.At the same time, price pressures started easing, with hopes that the Fed might pump the brakes on rate hikes.However, by mid-March, the market dropped over 4% from its February high, sliding into correction territory.It was flirting with 5,800 again by early April, with the early-year gains wiped out.However, markets didn’t stay down for long.The recovery picked up steam with strong jobs data, cooling inflation, and the Fed hinting at a more dovish stance.By the close of May, the index was back above 6,000.A big part of the recent bullishness is down to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in the Middle East, easing fears of a broader conflict.Early Thursday action had S&P 500 futures at 6,165.25, up 0.30%, above February’s all-time high of 6,144.In early action, the S&P 500 is near 6,130, within shooting distance of a fresh record and maybe a push higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite are trading at 43,249 and 20,064, respectively.Investors will be eying some major near-term catalysts.For starters, the Senate tax-cut bill aims for a July 4 passage, potentially swaying corporate earnings forecasts, sparking fresh momentum.Moreover, durable goods orders are expected to pop 8.6%, and a Q1 GDP revision showing a -0.2% slip, highlighting the economy’s resilience.Also, the Fed’s updated balance sheet drops later today, which will help assess how tight or loose financial conditions are at this point.Hence, with so many moving parts, every headline matters. But for now, even a modest bump in futures is keeping hopes alive that the S&P’s next record is within touching distance. first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 26, 2025","(['TheStreet ', ' 5 hours ago'],)","(['^SPX ', '^DJI '],)",NYSE closing bell may ring in S&P 500 history
"ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) -TRADING DAYMaking sense of the forces driving global marketsBy Jamie McGeever, Markets ColumnistThe dollar slid and stocks surged on Thursday as investors ramped up bets that U.S. interest rates will soon be cut, after President Donald Trump, in his latest attack on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, reportedly said he may name his replacement early.In my column today I look at where the ""pain trades"" for investors may lie in the second half of the year. More on that below, but first, a roundup of the main market moves.If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.1. Trump decision on Fed not imminent, source says 2. Investors shore up defences against another Augustmarket rout 3. Wall Street forecasts windfall for big U.S. banks fromFed plan to ease leverage rule 4. BoE echoes central banks' long bond sensitivity: MikeDolan 5. EU leaders meet to decide on whether to back quick U.S.trade deal or seek better termsToday's Key Market Moves* World stocks hit a fresh record peak, the S&P 500 andNasdaq both get to within a whisker of their all-time highs. * Dollar index falls to a 3-year low, the euro and sterlinghit highest since 2021, the Swiss franc hits a decade high. * Soaring FX caps stocks in Europe, where indices lag U.S.peers. In Asia, Japanese, Chinese stocks hit 5-month and 7-monthhighs, respectively. * U.S. Treasury yields fall to lowest since early May, alsopressured by weak U.S. economic data. Curve bull steepens. * Platinum rises another 4%, now up 34% this month - itsbest month in nearly 40 years and second best ever.Markets 'run it hot'Juice the economy. That seems to be the Trump administration's broad plan, which will be achieved in time by tax cuts, deregulation, and loose fiscal policy. And loose monetary policy. Most definitely loose monetary policy.Pressure from the White House on the Fed to cut interest rates is nothing new. The president has unleashed several verbal tirades towards Chair Jerome Powell for not doing so, branding him ""very stupid"", ""very dumb"" and of ""low IQ"".Powell's term as chair expires in May next year, and he insists he can't be fired. So Trump is now considering naming his replacement early, who could operate as a ""shadow"" Fed chair, undermining Powell's influence.It remains to be seen how effective or even viable this would be. But the fact it's being floated is pouring fuel on market moves that were already beginning to catch fire - the dollar is tumbling, Fed rate cut bets are being ramped up, stocks are flying, and ""Big Tech"" is getting its mojo back.The dollar on Thursday slumped to its lowest in more than three years against a basket of major currencies - performing especially poorly against European currencies - and is on track for its worst first half of any year in over half a century.The Trump administration will likely be quite happy with the way markets are reacting - a more export-competitive dollar, lower short-term yields, and higher stocks. And if you look further out, higher nominal growth and above-target inflation to inflate away the debt.The danger is these moves snowball and the dollar goes into a more rapid freefall, triggering widespread market dislocation. But we're not there yet, and investors are running with it.Hawkish Fed could inflict markets' biggest 'pain trades'As the first half of the year closes, financial markets are in limbo, waiting to see how the kaleidoscope of global trade deals will – or won't – come together after July 9, when Washington's pause on its ""reciprocal tariffs"" expires. But if investors are wrong-footed, which trades will be the most vulnerable?The state of suspended animation in today's markets isremarkably bullish. U.S. growth forecasts are rising, S&P 500earnings growth estimates for next year are running at a punchy14%, corporate deal-making is picking up, and world stocks areat record highs.The uncertainty immediately following President DonaldTrump's April 2 ""Liberation Day"" tariffs seems a distant memory.The relief rally has ripped for nearly three months, only takinga brief pause during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran.It's a pretty rosy outlook, some might say too rosy. If wedo see a pullback, what will be the biggest ""pain trades""?The major pressure points are, unsurprisingly, in assetclasses and markets where positioning and sentiment are mostoverloaded in one direction. As always with crowded trades, asudden price reversal can push too many investors to the exitdoor at once, meaning not all will get out in time.To identify the most overloaded positions, it's useful tolook at the Bank of America's monthly global fund managersurvey. In the June survey, the top three most-crowded tradesright now are long gold (according to 41% of those polled), long""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks (23%), and short U.S. dollar(20%).This popularity, of course, means these three trades havebeen highly profitable.The ""Mag 7"" basket of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Apple,Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla shares accounted for well over halfof the S&P 500's 58% two-year return in 2023 and 2024. TheRoundhill equal-weighted ""Mag 7"" ETF is up 40% this year, andthe Nasdaq 100 index, in which these seven stocks make up morethan half of the market cap, this week hit a record high.Meanwhile, the gold price has virtually doubled in the lasttwo-and-a-half years, smashing its way to a record high $3,500an ounce in April. And the dollar is down 10% this year, ontrack for its worst first half of any year since the era offree-floating exchange rates was established more than 50 yearsago.SLASH AND ... BURN?In some ways, these three trades are an offshoot of onefundamental bet: the deep-rooted view that the Federal Reservewill cut U.S. interest rates quite substantially in the next 18months, a scenario that would make all these positionsmoney-spinners.Even though the Fed's revised economic projections last weekwere notable for their hawkish tilt, rates futures markets havebeen upping their bets on lower rates, largely due to dovishcomments from several Fed officials and a sharp fall in oilprices. Traders are now predicting 125 basis points of rate cutsby the end of next year.Economists at Morgan Stanley are even more dovish,forecasting no change this year but 175 basis points of cutsnext year. That would take the Fed funds range down to2.5%-2.75%.Lower borrowing costs would be especially positive forshares in companies that can expect high future growth rates,like Big Tech. Low rates are also, in theory, good for gold, anon-interest-bearing asset.But, on the flip side, it's difficult to construct ascenario in which the economy is chugging along, supportingequity performance, while the Fed is also slashing rates by 175bps.Easing on that scale and at that speed would almostcertainly signal that the Fed was trying to put out a ragingeconomic fire, most likely a severe slowdown or recession. Whilerisk assets may not necessarily collapse in that environment,over-extended positions would be exposed.Granted, this isn't the first time investors have banked onFed cuts in the past three years, and we have yet to see a majorblow-up as a result. Markets have handled ""higher-for-longer""rates much better than many observers warned, soaring to newhighs in the process.Still, if ""pain trades"" do emerge in the second half of theyear, it will likely be because of one sore spot: a hawkish Fed.What could move markets tomorrow?* Japan retail sales (May) * Japan unemployment (May) * Japan Tokyo inflation (June) * Japan Softbank AGM * Euro zone sentiment indexes (June) * U.S. PCE inflation (May) * U.S. University of Michigan consumer sentiment, inflationexpectations (June, final) * Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack and Fed Governor LisaCook participate in 'Fed Listens' eventWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

"By Lisa BaertleinLOS ANGELES(Reuters) -Rates for shipping cargo containers from China to the U.S. have dropped by more than half since earlier this month, as imports rebounded less than expected after the slump that followed President Donald Trump slapping 145% tariffs on China.Trump quickly reversed course by lowering the rate to 30%. That cost increase on goods from the nation's No. 1 ocean trading partner remains significant, especially at a time when U.S. economic data is signaling weakness.Rates on the closely watched Shanghai-to-U.S. West Coast route appear to have found a near-term floor at around $2,500 per 40-foot container, after peaking early this month at around $6,000, Jefferies shipping analyst Omar Nokta said in a note on Thursday.Shipping rates had surged to their recent peaks after Trump cut tariffs on China to 30% from 145%. That led U.S. importers to rush in new orders on goods they had halted because of the astronomical levy.The retreat in shipping rates ""is a sign that the recent surge in imports to the U.S. ... will fail to have the lasting impact we had initially expected,"" maritime consultancy Drewry said on Thursday.Drewry's World Container Index fell 9% for the second consecutive week following five weeks of gains.U.S. consumers have yet to feel the full effects of tariffs because many importers stockpiled goods ahead of the new duties - delaying price hikes.Now, time is running out. Walmart, the world's largest retailer and top ocean importer, warned it would start raising prices in late May and June.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said he expects tariffs to start stoking inflation this summer.Tariffs have already risen on some goods, but there is a coming July 9 deadline for higher levies on a broad set of countries. No one is certain whether Trump will back down to a 10% baseline tariff that analysts are using as a minimum, or whether he will impose something more aggressive.Some maritime experts say Trump has painted the U.S. into a corner with his trade war.Import shipments to the U.S. virtually ceased in April, due to Trump's short-lived 145% tariffs on China. That volume is rebounding. But the bounce may be less than expected as tariffs begin to weigh on consumer spending and economic growth.""The more volume goes down, the less economic activity goes up. The less volume goes down, the more inflation goes up,"" said John McCown, senior fellow at the Center for Maritime Strategy.""There is actually no comfortable place to land.""(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by David Gregorio)","(['Reuters ', ' 55 minutes ago'],)","(['WMT '],)",US demand for China-made goods ebbs on tariff worries; ocean shipping rates drop

"(Reuters) -Options markets suggest the probability of a disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz is just 4% following the Iran-Israel ceasefire, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Thursday.Fears that Iran could close the Strait of Hormuz after U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities sent Brent crude futures to a high of $81.40 on Monday, but concerns eased in the wake of the truce declared the next day, sending crude back below $68.The sharp drop in the geopolitical risk premium likely reflected traders' recent experiences with major geopolitical shocks without significant oil disruptions, Iran's restrained response, strong U.S. and China incentives to avoid large disruptions, and the likely shift to large inventory builds from the fall, Goldman analysts said.Options markets see a 60% chance that Brent will stay in the $60s in three months and a 28% probability they would exceed $70, Goldman analysts said.Were oil flows to be disrupted through the Strait of Hormuz, Brent would climb to $90 a barrel, they said.(Reporting by Anjana Anil in Bengaluru; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Sonali Paul)","(['<div class=""publishing yf-1weyqlp"">Reuters <i aria-hidden=""true"" data-svelte-h=""svelte-sg6bkb"">•</i> 2 hours ago</div>'],)","(['<span class=""symbol yf-hwu3c7"">CL=F </span>'],)","<h3 class=""clamp  yf-10mgn4g"">Oil market reflects slim chance of supply disruption, Goldman analysts say</h3>"

"(Reuters) -Britain's vehicle production declined from a year ago for the fifth successive month in May, industry data showed on Friday, as factory disruptions and U.S. tariffs weighed on automakers.UK car and commercial vehicle production dropped 32.8% from a year ago to 49,810 units last month, marking the worst percentage drop in May output since 1949, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic-hit 2020, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.Exports to the UK's two biggest markets, the EU and the U.S., declined by 22.5% and 55.4% respectively, SMMT said.U.S. President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on imported automobiles and parts, imposed in March, have disrupted global supply chains, added hundreds of millions of dollars in costs for manufacturers, prompted export suspensions and pushed several automakers, especially in Europe, to consider shifting production to the U.S. to avoid the duties.British manufacturing also contracted in May, as output, orders and employment declined.Still, SMMT chief Mike Hawes said the UK's trade deals, especially with the U.S., and a more positive relationship with the EU, provided some optimism.The U.S. and UK reaffirmed a previously agreed trade deal during the G7 summit in Canada earlier this month, under which up to 100,000 UK-made cars a year can enter the U.S. at a 10% tariff, lower than the 25% rates other countries face.In May, Britain reached a trade deal with India to lower tariffs and set quotas on auto imports, while also moving closer to the European Union on cooperation in defence, energy and agriculture.Car production, excluding commercial vehicles, dropped by 31.5% in May, largely driven by model changeovers, restructuring and the impact of U.S. tariffs, SMMT said.(Reporting by DhanushVignesh Babu in Bengaluru; Editing by Sahal Muhammed)","(['<div class=""publishing yf-1weyqlp"">Reuters <i aria-hidden=""true"" data-svelte-h=""svelte-sg6bkb"">•</i> 3 hours ago</div>'],)","([],)","<h3 class=""clamp  yf-10mgn4g"">UK made fewer vehicles for the fifth straight month in May as tariffs bite</h3>"

"(Bloomberg) -- Trading desks across Asia are buzzing with excitement again, as the region shakes off tariff shocks and attracts investors with its solid growth prospects.Most Read from BloombergFrom stocks to currencies to credit, the rebound from the depths of the April market turmoil has been impressive. MSCI’s Asia equities index has jumped 25% to a four-year high, while a slump in the dollar has powered a regional currency gauge to the strongest since October. Companies are rushing to raise money to capitalize on the market’s reawakening.It marks a sharp reversal from the jitters that prevailed just a couple of months ago, when fears of a full-blown trade war and concerns that runaway inflation will limit central banks’ policy room weighed heavily on Asian assets. Instead, a weakening dollar has created space for interest-rate cuts across the region, with the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected easing likely to provide additional tailwinds.“Stocks have bounced back strongly from their April bottom, and investors are realizing they might have been too pessimistic about Trump’s tariffs,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. “Investors are realizing they might have been too pessimistic about tariffs,” he said. “Trump is showing more flexibility around his trade policies, and that’s driving optimism.”Take the demand for blockbuster share sales from Hong Kong to Tokyo as an example of the palpable excitement. So far, such deals across the region including initial public offerings have raised more than $90 billion, a 25% jump from this time last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.While Hong Kong has dominated larger deals, Japan’s capital market has also hummed along with this week, seeing the highest IPO volume since mid-March.Debt capital markets have also roared back to life after a dearth of deals at the height of volatility. Yield premiums on Asian investment-grade dollar bonds have come down from an April high of over 100 basis points to near 76 basis points, not far off a record low reached in February, a Bloomberg index shows.The tightening of Asian spreads is all the more impressive given a surge in dollar bond sales from the region, with this week seeing the largest volume of deals since March. Asia Pacific offerings in the US currency have climbed by about 45% this year to more than $200 billion.To be sure, the recent rebound has been global, as markets around the world enjoyed a relief rally. US stocks have also regained their mojo as the “sell America” trade lost steam. The Nasdaq 100 is at a fresh record and the S&P 500 is just shy of its February peak.Asian markets may face fresh volatility in the coming weeks. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television that President Donald Trump was prepared to finalize a slate of trade deals in connection with a July 9 deadline to reinstate higher tariffs he paused in April.“Given what we’ve been through in the last few months, I can’t help but think that there are a few more twists to come,” said Nick Twidale, chief analyst at AT Global Markets in Sydney. “The trade news is the most important factor for Asian markets.”Despite the looming uncertainties, the extent of resurgence in Asia’s export-reliant economies speaks to the region’s resilience. A softer dollar has bolstered the case for owning Asian assets. A Bloomberg dollar index is set for a sixth straight month of losses, the worst streak since 2017.Asian sovereign bonds have enjoyed a surge in inflows as investors looked to diversify and the region’s central banks embarked on interest-rate cuts. South Korea has especially stood out, receiving over $40 billion so far in 2025, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Local factors such as the removal of political uncertainty following the election of a new president have helped.“When I think about allocating to Asia, I think about the balance and defensiveness that it offers to the portfolio,” said Leonard Kwan, portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price in Hong Kong. “It’s a region that has got better fiscal and external positioning for the countries.”--With assistance from Finbarr Flynn, Malavika Kaur Makol and Yasutaka Tamura.(Updates with latest on trade deals in 10th paragraph, new comment in 11th.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","(['<div class=""publishing yf-1weyqlp"">Bloomberg <i aria-hidden=""true"" data-svelte-h=""svelte-sg6bkb"">•</i> 2 hours ago</div>'],)","(['<span class=""symbol yf-hwu3c7"">USD=X </span>', '<span class=""symbol yf-hwu3c7"">^NDX </span>'],)","<h3 class=""clamp  yf-10mgn4g"">Asian Markets in Full Swing as Investors Shake Off Trade Jitters</h3>"
"By Leika KiharaTOKYO (Reuters) -Core consumer inflation in Japan's capital slowed in June but stayed well above the central bank's 2% target, data showed on Friday, keeping alive market expectations for further interest rate hikes.The Tokyo consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 3.1% in June from a year earlier, government data showed, compared with a median market forecast for a 3.3% gain. It slowed from a 3.6% increase in May.A separate index for Tokyo that strips away both fresh food and fuel costs - closely watched by the Bank of Japan as a measure of domestic demand-driven prices - rose 3.1% in June from a year earlier after a 3.3% gain in May, the data showed.The BOJ exited a decade-long, radical stimulus programme last year and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5% in January on the view Japan was on the cusp of sustainably hitting its 2% inflation target.Governor Kazuo Ueda has said the BOJ will keep pushing up borrowing costs if continued wage gains underpin consumption and allow firms to raise prices, thereby maintaining inflation stably around its 2% target.The rising cost of living has drawn the attention of some BOJ board members including Naoki Tamura, who said on Wednesday the BOJ may need to raise interest rates ""decisively"" if upward inflation risks heighten.(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Sam Holmes)","(['<div class=""publishing yf-1weyqlp"">Reuters <i aria-hidden=""true"" data-svelte-h=""svelte-sg6bkb"">•</i> 2 hours ago</div>'],)","([],)","<h3 class=""clamp  yf-10mgn4g"">Core inflation in Japan's capital slows but stays above BOJ target</h3>"
"By Nicole Jao(Reuters) -Oil was set to fall this week with the Iran-Israel ceasefire holding and easing concerns over Middle East supply risks, although prices rose on Friday as the summer driving season ramped up fuel demand in the United States.Brent crude futures rose 34 cents, or 0.5%, to $68.07 a barrel by 0111 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 33 cents, or 0.51%, to $65.57 a barrel.The benchmarks were set to fall about 12% for the week.Oil futures hit their lowest in more than a week on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said a ceasefire had been agreed between Iran and Israel.Oil prices inched up on Thursday, though, as U.S. government data showed crude oil and fuel inventories fell last week, with refining activity and demand rising. [EIA/S]""The market is starting to digest the fact that crude oil inventories are very tight all of a sudden,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with the Price Futures Group.Also supporting oil prices, the dollar index sank to a three-year low on a report that President Donald Trump was planning to choose the next Federal Reserve chief early, fuelling fresh bets on U.S. interest rate cuts.A weaker dollar makes oil less expensive for holders of other currencies, increasing demand and supporting prices.Shortly before oil settled on Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the outcome of Israel's war with Iran presented opportunities for peace that his country must not waste, easing concerns of continuing supply risks.(Reporting by Nicole Jao; Editing by Tom Hogue)","(['<div class=""publishing yf-1weyqlp"">Reuters <i aria-hidden=""true"" data-svelte-h=""svelte-sg6bkb"">•</i> 1 hour ago</div>'],)","(['<span class=""symbol yf-hwu3c7"">CL=F </span>'],)","<h3 class=""clamp  yf-10mgn4g"">Oil set for weekly loss on fading Mideast supply risks</h3>"

Yet that's exactly what happened with Equinix; on analyst day, it  for its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), the key profitability line item for real estate investment trusts () like itself. Management is forecasting 5% to 9% annual growth from 2025 through 2029.The No. 1 reason for this is that the heavy demand for artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities requires significant expansion in data center capacity. So, a company like Equinix that specializes in such facilities is essentially forced to spend now to reap the benefits later.Regardless, analysts didn't hesitate to become more bearish on the company. In fact, several institutions (such as  and BMO Capital Markets) downgraded their recommendations on the stock.Personally, I don't think that's fair. Intensifying capital expenditure requirements are entirely justified, given that so many developers and end users want robust AI functionality as soon as humanly possible, without bottlenecks. It's data center operators like Equinix that have to pay up front for this, at least at the current stage.This stock's double-digit dip is, therefore, a good opportunity to buy a good company cheaply, in my view. Yes, profitability will be dinged for a while, but I think Equinix has great potential for patient investors who are willing to wait it out over the long term.Before you buy stock in Equinix, consider this:The  analyst team just identified what they believe are the  for investors to buy now… and Equinix wasn’t one of them.

"By Ankur BanerjeeSINGAPORE (Reuters) -The dollar drifted on Friday, hovering near its lowest level in 3-1/2 years against the euro and sterling, as traders wagered on deeper U.S. rate cuts while awaiting trade deals ahead of a July deadline for President Donald Trump's tariffs.Market focus this week has been on U.S. monetary policy. The prospect of Trump announcing the next Federal Reserve Chair, who is expected to be more dovish, earlier than usual to undermine the current chair Jerome Powell has raised odds of the central bank cutting rates.Powell, whose term ends in May, was also interpreted as being more dovish this week in testimony to U.S. Congress, adding to expectation of more rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in 64 basis points of easing this year versus 46 bps expected on Friday.""The sooner a replacement is announced for Powell, the sooner he could be perceived to be a ‘lame duck’,"" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Trump has toyed with the idea of selecting and announcing Powell's replacement by September or October, a move analysts say could lead to the person operating as a shadow Fed chair, undermining Powell’s influence.Trump has not decided on a replacement for Powell and a decision is not imminent, a person familiar with the White House's deliberations told Reuters on Thursday.""Such an outcome could introduce some volatility into financial markets if the nominee makes public comments markedly different to the current chair,"" CBA's Kong said.""For now, expectations President Trump will choose a more dovish chair will keep downward pressure on FOMC pricing and the USD.""The euro was steady at $1.1693 in early trading after hitting $1.1745 in the previous session, its highest since September 2021. Sterling last fetched $1.3733, just below the October 2021 top of $1.37701 touched on Thursday.The dollar index, which measures the U.S. unit versus six other currencies, was lingering near its lowest since March 2022 at 97.378, on course for a 2% decline in June, its sixth straight month in the red.The index has dropped more than 10% this year as Trump's tariffs stoke U.S. growth worries, leading investors to look for alternatives.The yen was a bit weaker at 144.73 per dollar, while the Swiss franc was last at 0.8013 per dollar, perched near its strongest level in a decade.Investor attention will also be on progress on trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline for Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs as nations scramble to get an agreement over the line with the clock ticking.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Thursday the EU should do a ""quick and simple"" trade deal with the United States rather than a ""slow and complicated"" one.A White House official said on Thursday the U.S. has reached an agreement with China on how to expedite rare earths shipments to the United States.(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore; Editing by Jamie Freed)","(['<div class=""publishing yf-1weyqlp"">Reuters <i aria-hidden=""true"" data-svelte-h=""svelte-sg6bkb"">•</i> 58 minutes ago</div>'],)","([],)","<h3 class=""clamp  yf-10mgn4g"">Dollar lingers near 3-1/2-year low as traders bet on US rate cuts</h3>"
"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's industrial profits swung back into a sharp decline in May from a year earlier, as factories slowed activity in the face of broader economic stress and a fragile trade truce with the United States.Deepening deflationary pressures and a persistent property crisis continued to undercut demand and economic growth despite an unexpected pickup in retail growth last month.Profits at China's industrial firms fell 9.1% in May from a year earlier, snapping a two-month growth streak, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Friday.Industrial profits slid 1.1% in the first five months of 2025 from the same period last year. This compares with a 1.4% increase in the January-April period.The profit decline was due to ""insufficient effective demand, declining prices of industrial products and fluctuations in short-term factors,"" said NBS statistician Yu Weining.With U.S. tariffs set to remain high, factories are facing immense strains, particularly in sectors such as autos where excessive competition has prompted an official call to end bruising price wars.Local auto dealers have appealed for automakers to stop dumping cars on dealerships, saying the intense price war was damaging their cash flow, driving down their profitability and forcing some to shut.Profits at state-owned firms dropped 7.4% in the first five months. Private-sector companies recorded a 0.3% increase and foreign firms saw a 3.4% rise, according to a breakdown of the official data.Industrial profit numbers cover firms with annual revenue of at least 20 million yuan ($2.78 million) from their main operations.(Reporting by Qiaoyi Li and Ryan Woo; Editing by Jacqueline Wong & Shri Navaratnam)","(['<div class=""publishing yf-1weyqlp"">Reuters <i aria-hidden=""true"" data-svelte-h=""svelte-sg6bkb"">•</i> 21 minutes ago</div>'],)","([],)","<h3 class=""clamp  yf-10mgn4g"">China's industrial profits slip back into sharp decline in May</h3>"

They kept buying even in early April when the S&P 500 teetered on the brink of a bear market and institutional money managers sold out during the depths of the tariff-fueled market meltdown.Buying Dips Works“Let’s go back to the various dips that we’ve seen in the market, starting with Covid,” said Paul Nolte, market strategist and senior wealth adviser at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “Every time that the market declined in a very short fashion, investors have learned: Buy the dip and buy the higher-beta type stocks.”Large-cap technology behemoths have been the main drivers of the markets in the past two years. They had a brief hiatus earlier this year when the rise of Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek raised concerns about who will dominate AI, but tech giants are back in the driver’s seat, leading the sharp recovery in the S&P 500 since the tariff selloff.“Once the tariffs kind of de-escalated, investors came back to the dominant theme, which is AI,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.This strong focus on big tech is even holding back one risky corner of the market — small-cap stocks. The small-capitalization Russell 2000 Index and the S&P 600 Index, which unlike the Russell only includes profitable smaller companies, are both lagging the S&P 500 this year and quarter.Strategists point out that technology has a relatively lighter weight in these small-cap gauges. Information technology and communication services together have a nearly 43% weight in the S&P 500, but just 13% in the Russell 2000 and and about 16% in the S&P 600.The strength of tech firms is also driving profit growth at the index level. The S&P 500’s earnings this year are estimated to grow about 8% from last year, with information technology the strongest anticipated gainer at nearly 21%. Expectations for other sectors pale in comparison.“In a time of uncertainty around earnings, investors are gravitating towards areas that have more of a secular theme,” Truist’s Lerner said.(Updates Goldman Sachs gauge performance in third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","(['<div class=""publishing yf-1weyqlp"">Bloomberg <i aria-hidden=""true"" data-svelte-h=""svelte-sg6bkb"">•</i> 6 hours ago</div>'],)","(['<span class=""symbol yf-hwu3c7"">^SPX </span>', '<span class=""symbol yf-hwu3c7"">^SP600 </span>'],)","<h3 class=""clamp  yf-10mgn4g"">Wall Street Goes All-In on Risky Stocks</h3>"
"(Bloomberg) -- US Treasuries were headed for a third week of advances, rallying on Thursday after economic data releases reinforced bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.Most Read from BloombergThe move pushed down yields across maturities, with most tenors falling to the lowest level in more than a month. A Bloomberg Treasuries index has returned about 0.6% for the week.“We’re going to continue to rock and roll for a few reasons, in terms of lower yields,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities. “There’s a real fear out there that the unemployment number a week from today is going to be a lot weaker. We’ll have month-end on Monday which could see some reallocation from equities to bonds.”Traders are turning their attention to the jobs report as it will provide a key data point ahead of the Fed’s meeting later in the month. They are already fully pricing in two cuts by year-end, starting in September, and wagers on a third quarter-point reduction could gain momentum if the number is weak.On Thursday, the growth rate for personal spending during the first quarter — part of a revision to US first-quarter gross domestic product — was unexpectedly revised to 0.5% from 1.2%. Other economic data points — including fewer-than-expected initial jobless claims — showed unexpected strength.Short-dated bonds — which are more tied to the outlook for Fed policy — gained the most following the release, with two-year yields dipping seven basis points to 3.71% by the end of the session. The widely watched spread between the five- and 30-year points increased to more than 101 basis points for the first time since 2021 and a $44 billion auction of seven-year notes was well received. A steepening yield curve is generally associated with expectations for Fed rate cuts.Some bonds were already gaining before the economic data releases following a report in the Wall Street Journal suggesting President Donald Trump is considering naming a successor to Fed chief Jerome Powell as soon as September or October.“Today’s data showed further weakness,” said Tracy Chen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. In addition, the potential early announcement of the next Fed Chair “and perceived less Fed independence will likely contribute further to the steepener move.”Investors and analysts reckon Powell’s replacement will grant the president’s demands that the Fed cut interest rates right away causing traders to price in faster and deeper cuts beginning around mid-2026, when Powell’s term ends. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in the past week have signaled they’d be open to lowering rates as soon as the next meeting.“Waller and Bowman pushing for early rate cuts has helped the front end to rally, with the curve steepening in the process,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of the BlueBay Fixed Income unit at RBC Global Asset Management. “Trump’s move to announce a Fed Chair early can increase political pressure on the Fed to cut rates and this is also a factor leading to a steeper curve.”Wagers on lower interest rates weighed on the dollar, which weakened against all of its Group-of-10 peers. The Bloomberg’s Dollar Spot Index slumped 0.5% to the lowest level in more than three years. Michael Pfister, an FX analyst at Commerzbank AG, says the euro could climb to $1.18 in the coming days if policymakers continue to price in earlier rate cuts.Potential contenders to succeed Powell include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former World Bank President David Malpass and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Bloomberg News has previously reported.Last week, US rates traders amassed a record futures bet that whomever Trump appoints will lead the central bank to cut interest rates almost immediately.In a Bloomberg Television interview, BlackRock Inc. portfolio manager Russell Brownback said the market would push back if the Fed’s independence began to come into question.“The markets would protest any kind of degradation of that independence very quickly,” he said. “I believe in the sanctity of the institution.”--With assistance from Anya Andrianova, Alice Atkins, Ruth Carson and Ye Xie.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","(['<div class=""publishing yf-1weyqlp"">Bloomberg <i aria-hidden=""true"" data-svelte-h=""svelte-sg6bkb"">•</i> 6 hours ago</div>'],)","(['<span class=""symbol yf-hwu3c7"">BLK </span>', '<span class=""symbol yf-hwu3c7"">CRZBF </span>'],)","<h3 class=""clamp  yf-10mgn4g"">US Treasuries Poised for Third Week of Gains on Rate-Cut Bets</h3>"

"Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Affiliated Managers Group (AMG). AMG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 7.65, while its industry has an average P/E of 17.02. AMG's Forward P/E has been as high as 8.93 and as low as 6.14, with a median of 7.39, all within the past year.Investors should also note that AMG holds a PEG ratio of 0.59. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AMG's industry has an average PEG of 1.20 right now. Over the past 52 weeks, AMG's PEG has been as high as 0.71 and as low as 0.47, with a median of 0.57.We should also highlight that AMG has a P/B ratio of 1.31. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.63. Over the past 12 months, AMG's P/B has been as high as 1.39 and as low as 1.01, with a median of 1.27.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. AMG has a P/S ratio of 2.65. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 3.03.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Affiliated Managers Group's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, AMG looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"By Rae WeeSINGAPORE (Reuters) -Asia shares hit their highest level in more than three years on Friday as they tracked a Wall Street rally, though the dollar struggled on concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence and expectations for early rate cuts.Stock indexes worldwide look set to end the week on a positive note, with worries about tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty over tariffs and trade deals on the backburner for now.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched its strongest level since November 2021 early in the session. It last traded 0.2% higher and is set to clock a 3% gain for the week.Japan's Nikkei jumped 1.5% and surpassed the 40,000 mark for the first time in five months.Reasons for the upbeat mood included news that Washington has reached an agreement with Beijing on how to expedite rare earth shipments to the United States.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said on Thursday that he has asked Republicans in Congress to scrap the Section 899 retaliatory tax proposal from their tax and spending bill after Washington reached an agreement with Group of Seven industrial countries.""That was something that had been making some investors, especially foreign investors, nervous when that provision was passed by the House. So if that provision gets removed, then that allays one of the concerns from foreign investors,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ.""The cumuluation of these various... positive developments all helped to contribute to the buoyant market mood we're seeing.""European futures also gained, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures and DAX futures both up 0.6%, while FTSE futures advanced 0.16%.U.S. stock futures were little changed, though Wall Street had on Thursday closed near record highs, further supported by expectations of imminent Fed rate cuts.FED CUTS COMINGMuch of the focus for markets over the past two sessions has been on the prospect of an early change of guard at the Fed, after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. President Donald Trump has toyed with the idea of selecting and announcing Fed Chair Jerome Powell's replacement by September or October.That knocked an already battered dollar even lower as traders fretted about an erosion of Fed independence and as they moved to price in more U.S. rate cuts this year.The dollar languished near a 3-1/2-year low on Friday and was headed for a 1.4% weekly loss, its largest decline in over a month.For the year, the greenback is already down more than 10% and if it stays that way in the next few days, that will mark its biggest first half-of-a-year fall since the start of the era of free-floating currencies in the early 1970s.Against a weaker dollar, the euro was perched near its highest in over three years at $1.1688. Sterling rose 0.03% to $1.3730.""Trump's desire to 'shadow' the Fed using a designated replacement for Chair Jay Powell isn't a good way to promote the perceptions of integrity and autonomy in U.S. policymaking and, by extension, that of the reserve currency status of the U.S. dollar,"" said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group.Adding to the Fed cut bets has been a raft of weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data, with attention now shifting to Friday's release of the core PCE price index, the U.S. central bank's preferred measure of inflation.U.S. Treasury yields were steady in Asia after falling the previous session, with the two-year yield at 3.7418% and the benchmark 10-year yield last at 4.2554%.In commodities, oil prices were set for a weekly decline with the Iran-Israel ceasefire holding and easing concerns over Middle East supply risks.

"Buffett has built a fortune by sticking to the basics, such as companies with strong brands and consistent, growing profits -- and holding for the long run.Many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks trade at lofty valuations and have unpredictable growth prospects, making them speculative opportunities.One semiconductor stock sticks out to me given its discounted valuation relative to peers, robust long-run prospects, and leading market position.Warren Buffett is one of the most prolific investors in modern history. For six decades, he helped build  into an investment powerhouse --  over this period. For reference, these returns are nearly double the total return of the .One aspect of  that is rather unique, however, is that he did not pack Berkshire's portfolio with growth stocks or seek opportunities in emerging technologies. For these reasons, you won't find much in the way of software, artificial intelligence (AI), or semiconductors among Buffett's top stocks.Let's explore some of the pillars supporting Buffett's investment criteria. From there, I'll make the case for which AI chip stock I think fits many of Buffett's requirements -- making it a unique value opportunity in an otherwise high-growth industry at the moment.Some of the largest positions in Berkshire's portfolio include , , , , , and .There are a number of threads that stitch these companies together. First, each has achieved a high level of brand equity. This keeps consumers loyal over time, thereby insulating the overall business from competitive forces.In addition, each of these companies generates heaps of cash. Cash flow is important, as it provides the business with the financial flexibility to reinvest into new products or reward investors in the form of share buybacks or dividends.Finally, Buffett is a contrarian. While some of the companies above may face cyclical risks, Buffett has remained steadfast in his ability to look past short-term headwinds and keep the long-term growth narrative in focus. As a value investor, he often pounces on opportunities that others have discounted.One AI stock that I think checks off many of Buffett's boxes is  . But don't take my word for it, Berkshire did briefly own Taiwan Semi stock a couple of years ago.On the surface, this pick may come across as unusual. After all, Taiwan Semi faces some geopolitical risk given uncertainties surrounding its relationship with China. In fact, these risk factors played a role in Berkshire eventually exiting its TSMC position back in 2023. Moreover, the chip industry is highly cyclical, adding yet another layer of uncertainty surrounding the company's growth.Like Buffett, however, I'm going to act as a contrarian to support my personal long-term bull thesis surrounding TSMC.Similar to many stocks in Berkshire's portfolio, Taiwan Semi has built a robust brand moat. While the company faces some competition from  and , industry research suggests that Taiwan Semi owns more than 60% of the foundry market. Not only does this provide TSMC with a healthy lead over the competition, but secular tailwinds could actually help the company separate from the pack even more.Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure spend to reach nearly $7 trillion by next decade. Furthermore, McKinsey is forecasting that almost half of this spending will be allocated toward hardware for data centers.With new chipsets expected to be released by  and , in combination with custom silicon solutions from cloud hyperscalers , , and , I am optimistic that Taiwan Semi's fabrication services will continue to see robust demand over the coming years.The chart below illustrates the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple trend for TSMC and other leading chip stocks over the past year.The obvious takeaway from the chart is that Taiwan Semi trades for a steep discount relative to Nvidia and , based on forward earnings ratios. This could suggest that Taiwan Semi is an undervalued opportunity within the chip space right now. With that said, a forward P/E of 22.2 is above the historical average for the S&P 500 -- which is around 17.While Buffett likely wouldn't see Taiwan Semi as a value stock, I would counter this due to the fact that the broader market is trading at lofty valuations in general, and TSMC is still much more reasonably priced compared to its chip peers.In addition, Wall Street's consensus forecasts suggest Taiwan Semi has significant growth in store over the next few years. Thanks to ongoing infrastructure spending and robust demand for chips, TSMC could nearly double its profitability over just the next two years.Given the company's long-run growth prospects and rising profitability profile, I think Taiwan Semi is a bargain and investors should consider this monster opportunity for the long haul.Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The  analyst team just identified what they believe are the  for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

"(Bloomberg) -- Investors betting against Palantir Technologies Inc. are throwing in the towel as the software maker’s shares keep pushing higher, aided by fervent retail traders and heightened geopolitical tensions.Most Read from BloombergShort interest in Palantir as a percentage of shares available to trade is about 2%, down from a high of 5% in October, according to data from S3 Partners. The stock has rallied nearly 300% over that span, handing short sellers paper losses of roughly $7 billion. Shares extended that gain in early trading Thursday, rising as much as 3.7%, on track for a record close.Palantir, which makes software used by governments and corporations to analyze large volumes of data, is the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year amid excitement about its artificial intelligence products and signs that it’s winning more business from the Trump administration. Palantir is also the most expensive stock in the benchmark, however, with a price to estimated sales ratio of 76 times. Nvidia Corp., by contrast, is priced at 17 times.The momentum behind Palantir, which helped send shares to a fresh intraday record on Wednesday, has made it dangerous to bet against, even though the valuation is difficult to justify, said Thomas George, president at Grizzle Investment Management.“The frenzy can go on for longer than the bears or shorts would like, and we’ve seen too many people get their fingers chopped off trying to short something,” George said. “It really feels like the stock is trading on vibes.”While Palantir stands out on Wall Street for both its lofty multiple and the size of its rally, the stock has proven remarkably resilient, frustrating those betting on a reversal. Some have even likened it to a meme stock, given the heavy interest from retail investors who think demand for AI software will keep Palantir’s revenue expanding at a rapid clip.Palantir’s work with government and military customers has been in particular focus in recent sessions as US strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran over the weekend raised the specter of a broader conflict in the Middle East. President Donald Trump announced a surprise ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran following more than a week of drone and missile attacks between the countries.“Palantir is in the right area code for the future of defense tech, so the market could view a fair tailwind from the events over the weekend,” George said. It “is clearly a beneficiary of heightened geopolitical tensions, but even heightened geopolitical tensions don’t justify Palantir’s valuation.”The Denver-based company is expected to see sales jump 36% this year, followed by an expansion of 29% in 2026, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That places Palantir among the fastest growing companies in the Nasdaq 100.Valuation is the key sticking point on Wall Street. Fewer than a third of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, an unusually low rate among companies with market capitalizations in excess of $300 billion. Based on the average price target, analysts see downside of 25% over the coming year, the weakest implied return in the Nasdaq 100 Index.The institutional hesitancy has been overshadowed by heavy interest from individual investors. In terms of client orders, Palantir is consistently one of the most active securities on Interactive Brokers’ platform, according to the firm’s data. Vanda Research, which analyzes retail trading, ranks Palantir as the third-highest stock by net retail purchases, behind Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp., which are both substantially larger.“Palantir trades at a ridiculous multiple, but welcome to the world of AI stocks,” said Louis Navellier, chief executive officer of Navellier & Associates, who owns the stock.“The stock should be safe in the near term, since there’s certainly a need for cost-efficient intel and I don’t think the AI party will end soon,” he said. “Still, while the short sellers have gotten pretty quiet, the multiple means they’ll come back. They always do.”Tech Chart of the DayNvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world.Top Tech NewsMicron Technology Inc., Wall Street’s favorite chipmaker this year, delivered an outlook that wasn’t quite rosy enough to keep its 2025 rally going.After a chastening crackdown that wiped billions off their value and forced top executives out of the public eye, China’s technology giants are back in favor and on the front foot, making deals and snapping up assets.The unveiling of Xiaomi Corp.’s first electric SUV on Thursday will showcase how the Chinese tech company has become an investor darling with its high-stakes bet on the auto market.Reconova Technologies Co., a Chinese artificial intelligence company specializing in visual perception, is planning a Hong Kong initial public offering as soon as this year, according to people familiar with the matter.Earnings Due ThursdayNo major earnings expected--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.(Adds stock move after market open in second paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","(['<div class=""publishing yf-1weyqlp"">Bloomberg <i aria-hidden=""true"" data-svelte-h=""svelte-sg6bkb"">•</i> 12 hours ago</div>'],)","(['<span class=""symbol yf-hwu3c7"">NVDA </span>', '<span class=""symbol yf-hwu3c7"">TSLA </span>'],)","<h3 class=""clamp  yf-10mgn4g"">Palantir Short Sellers Bail as Top S&amp;P 500 Stock Keeps Climbing</h3>"
"Shares of  (ASC) have gained 6.4% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $10.08, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $13.17 indicates a potential upside of 30.7%.The average comprises three short-term price targets ranging from a low of $12.50 to a high of $14.00, with a standard deviation of $0.76. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 24% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 38.9% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for ASC, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.There has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 16.2%.Moreover, ASC currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much ASC could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"The second quarter of 2025 saw sharp volatility in the U.S. stock market, driven by Trump’s aggressive tariff policies and escalating geopolitical tensions. The S&P 500 is now less than 1% away from an all-time high, a stunning turnaround considering the index was teetering on the edge of a bear market just two months ago.With just a few days left to end the second quarter, the Nasdaq Composite Index outperformed, jumping 15.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Index gained 8.5% and 2.3%, respectively. We have highlighted five top-performing ETFs from different industries that were the leaders in the second quarter. These are  URA,  CRPT, ARKW, HERO and  GOEX.After nearly entering a bear market in April and erasing $9.8 trillion in market value, the S&P 500 rebounded sharply in May and June, fueled by a strong comeback in tech stocks and trade negotiation optimism. The S&P 500 jumped 6.15% in May, its best monthly gain since November 2023 and its strongest May since 1990. It has added another 3% so far in June, regaining trillions in market value.Renewed enthusiasm for U.S. tech and AI stocks, especially NVIDIA NVDA and Microsoft MSFT, bolstered investors’ sentiment during the quarter. The Nasdaq 100 hit a fresh record high on Tuesday, its first since February. With rates still high and volatility lingering, the mega-cap tech names are proving to be the market’s new safe haven (read: 5 Stocks Driving Nasdaq 100 ETF Higher in 2025).Trump has softened his stance on tariffs and taken a measured approach to trade negotiations. While only a trade deal with the UK and a tentative truce with China have been announced, many investors believe the worst of the tariff fallout may be behind them.The average tariff rates are now at their highest in 90 years. Such elevated levels could suppress growth, reignite inflation, and keep interest rates elevated, thereby creating headwinds for stocks in the short term.Hopes of de-escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict boosted market sentiment this week, easing risk-off pressures. Let’s dig into the details of the abovementioned ETFs:Global X Uranium ETF provides investors access to a broad range of companies involved in uranium mining and the production of nuclear components, including those in extraction, refining, exploration, or manufacturing of equipment for the uranium and nuclear industries.

"Marvell Technology nosedived earlier this year after providing disappointing guidance.Tariffs and economic uncertainty continue to weigh on the California-based chipmaker.Its valuation has come way down, which could make it more appealing now to investors.Shares of Marvell were already beginning to decline before its guidance miss earlier in the year, likely due to its inflated valuation. The stock had been an expensive buy, trading at a  of more than 40 (based on analyst expectations). At such a high premium, analysts are expecting the company to not only post strong numbers, but also to provide a strong guidance.Currently, however, Marvell stock trades at a forward P/E of 26, which is only slightly higher than the 23 times forward P/E of the average stock on the S&P 500. With Marvell generating revenue growth in excess of 60% in its most recent quarter, the higher premium may very well be justifiable if it can maintain a high level of growth.But the risk is that tariffs and potentially slowing economic conditions could affect its top and bottom lines in the near future. Should that happen, this stock could once again start to look very expensive.Before you buy stock in Marvell Technology, consider this:The  analyst team just identified what they believe are the  for investors to buy now… and Marvell Technology wasn’t one of them.

" ICE hit a 52-week high of $181.65 on June 25. Shares closed at $180.53 after gaining 21.2% year to date, outperforming the industry, the sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite in the same time frame.Intercontinental has outperformed its peers, including CBOE, CME and NDAQ. Shares of CBOE, CME and NDAQ have gained 17.9%, 17.6% and 13.9%, respectively, year to date.With a market capitalization of $103.55 billion, the average number of shares traded in the last three months was 3.2 million.Shares of Intercontinental are trading above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) of $173.34 and $164.01, respectively, indicating solid upward momentum. SMA is a widely used technical analysis tool to predict future price trends by analyzing historical price data.Intercontinental shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings of 24.72X, lower than the industry average of 26.25X. Its pricing, at a discount to the industry average, gives a better entry point to investors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Intercontinental Exchange’s 2025 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 14.5%. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.96 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 7.3%. The consensus estimate for 2026 earnings per share and revenues indicates an increase of 10.4% and 5.7%, respectively, from the corresponding 2025 estimates. The expected long-term earnings growth rate is 13.3%, outperforming the industry average of 10.1%.Seven of the nine analysts covering the stock have raised estimates for 2025, while seven of the 10 analysts have raised the same for 2026 over the past 60 days. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 and 2026 moved 1.3% and 1.2% north, respectively, in the last 60 days.Based on short-term price targets offered by 17 analysts, the Zacks average price target is $194.18 per share. The average suggests a potential 7.3% upside from the last closing price.Intercontinental surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters and matched in one, the average being 1.30%.ICE’s top line is poised to improve on strength in global data services and index business, growth in pricing and reference data business, and strength in ICE Global Network offering, solid desktop, feeds and derivatives analytics. The company has been achieving expense synergies from strategic acquisitions, which have also strengthened its portfolio and expanded its presence.ICE boasts the largest mortgage network across the United States and thus remains well-positioned to benefit from accelerated digitization in the residential mortgage industry.ICE continuously engages in strategic investments supported by a healthy and minimal risk-based balance sheet, which also offers stability and buoyancy over the medium to long term.However, operating expenses have been increasing over the last several years, weighing on margin expansion. With continuous growth initiatives like product launches and technology upgrades, we believe that expenses are likely to remain elevated in the near term.Though the debt balance declined, its leverage as well as times interest earned compares unfavorably with the industry average.ICE is poised for growth, banking on the strength of its compelling portfolio and expansive risk-management services, which also ensure revenue flow, as well as strategic buyouts, a solid balance sheet and effective capital deployment. Its dividend history is impressive. It has more than doubled its dividends in the last six years.Optimistic analyst sentiment, favorable growth estimates, as well as attractive valuations, should continue to benefit ICE over the long term.It is, therefore, wise to hold on to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock at present.

"Investors in AMTM need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the July 18, 2025 $30.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other.

"Big banks like JPM,  GS and  BAC are expected to easily clear the 2025 stress test, the results of which will be released tomorrow, given that this year’s test will be less stressful than last year.A less severe scenario this year implies that banks will perform better and be in a position to return more money to investors via share repurchases and dividends.Each year, the Federal Reserve’s stress test assesses the capacity of the biggest U.S. banks to withstand a significant economic downturn. The “annual health checkup” is used to determine the most recent minimum capital requirements, which are intended to cushion potential losses. It further dictates the size of share repurchases and dividends.Notably, the 2008 financial crisis gave rise to this annual assessment, which covered institutions with at least $100 billion in assets.The Fed evaluates the financial resilience of banks by estimating losses, revenues, expenses and resulting capital levels under hypothetical economic conditions. A baseline scenario and a severely adverse scenario are used for assessment.The severely adverse scenario is characterized by a hypothetical severe global recession accompanied by a period of heightened stress in commercial and residential real estate markets, and corporate debt markets.This year, the severely adverse scenario features a slightly smaller increase in the unemployment rate from the 2024 severely adverse scenario. The current scenario also features slightly smaller declines in house prices and a fall in commercial real estate prices that is 10% less than that in 2024.Thus, a favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration is expected to make the 22 banks that are tested more flexible as they manage capital and increase dividends.Vivek Juneja, an analyst at JPMorgan, said, “With the improved regulatory tone, hopes are high for some reduction in capital requirements... driven by less harsh stress tests.”Despite the more stressful scenarios last year, big banks took turns returning excess capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases after clearing the test.JPMorgan raised its quarterly dividend 8.7% to $1.25 per share. It was the second time that the company raised its quarterly dividend in 2024. JPM also authorized a $30-billion share repurchase program, which became effective on July 1, 2024.Likewise, Goldman Sachs’ capital plan included an increase in the common stock dividend from $2.75 to $3.00 per share. Bank of America also increased its dividend in third-quarter 2024.While this year’s situation is expected to be better than last year, with big banks anticipated to announce higher dividend increases, banks will likely remain somewhat conservative in the near term, given the ongoing tariff-related uncertainty, along with other geopolitical concerns.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is a convenient way to invest in prominent, dividend-paying stocks.The ETF has delivered a mix of growth and passive income throughout its history.A high starting yield and attractive valuation make it great to buy and hold for the long term.Investors should always diversify their portfolios, but it's absolutely crucial when it comes to dividend stocks. It would be a nightmare scenario if something happened to a stock that you depended on for a significant chunk of your investment income.Fortunately,  make diversification quick and straightforward. One fund could represent hundreds, even thousands, of individual companies. The  is one of the best dividend ETFs to buy for anyone looking for decades of passive income.Here are five reasons why any long-term dividend investor should consider buying and holding it forever.The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the , a bucket of approximately 100 large-cap U.S. dividend stocks across various market sectors, including energy, consumer staples, healthcare, industrials, financials, technology, consumer discretionary, and communications services.The ETF features mature companies with track records of paying and raising dividends. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF's top 10 positions account for 41% of the fund and include:Company NamePercentage of ETF4.44%4.32%4.22%4.18%4.13%4.09%4.09%4.06%3.81%3.77%Data source: The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF prospectus. Table by author.The remainder is spread across abiut 90 dividend stocks, offering investors a healthy dose of portfolio diversification through a single ticker symbol.An investment's initial dividend yield isn't everything; a lot of the magic happens over time as the dividend grows. Still, unless you're very young, it's nice to start with meaningful dividend income.The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF delivers an impressive 30-day  of almost 3.9% at its current price. For comparison, the  yields approximately 1.3%, so investors are getting roughly three times as much passive income for their buck as they would from the broader U.S. stock market.Ideally, your investment income will grow over time -- at least fast enough to keep up with inflation. Fortunately, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has done well here, too. As shown, the fund's dividend has trended in the right direction over time, growing by more than 500% cumulatively since its inception in late 2011.The ETF rebalances quarterly and reconstitutes annually, so its makeup could change over time, and the dividend may not always increase at this rate. Still, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has demonstrated over the past 14 years that it's reasonable to anticipate those dividends growing larger over the decades to come.There is sometimes a misperception that investing for passive income must come at the expense of total investment returns. While it's true that stocks of mature companies often come with higher dividend yields and lower price appreciation, investors can still achieve a mix of both income and growth, and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has delivered just that outcome.The ETF doesn't attempt to track the S&P 500 index, but it has produced competitive total investment returns for most of its existence, up until the past few years. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF only has about 8% exposure to the technology sector, which has caused the ETF to lag the ""Magnificent Seven""-heavy S&P 500 since the artificial intelligence (AI) boom began in 2023.The AI boom has lifted the broader market to a lofty valuation. The S&P 500's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (28) is notably above its average over the past decade. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF's blended P/E ratio is currently 16. Many of the ETF's top holdings aren't exactly high-growth names, but it's clear that the ETF trades at a steep discount to the broader market, and at a time when the latter is trading well above its norms.This doesn't matter as much if you're buying the ETF to hold for decades of passive income, but it's always good to buy up a deal, and the ETF's current valuation means it could perform better relative to the broader market if the AI craze cools off some.Before you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:The  analyst team just identified what they believe are the  for investors to buy now… and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn’t one of them.
